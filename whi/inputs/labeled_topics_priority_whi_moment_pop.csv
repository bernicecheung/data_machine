Although not 100% safe, generally I would go to work in the morning, come home at night and maybe do some yard work. So I'm not really outside all that much in my neighborhood. I don't know very many people in my neighborhood, even though I've lived here for 20 years and there definitely is crime in the area. But I pretty much keep to myself. So I don't feel like I'm affected that much. I'm not afraid to go on a walk in at night in the dark. I don't think it's that type of scary. So I feel like it's pretty safe. I also don't, but I didn't put completely agree because I don't know a lot of people in my area, but that's completely my fault for not learning.",24_neighborhood_live_houses_theres,neighborhood
1,628c2454c8c66010dd87391d,QOL_1,"I feel as if the answer is, is as complicated because I feel as if this community has a lot to offer. But at the same time, it doesn't. And the answer for that is because of the size, the size of the community is pretty small. This town only has about 60,000 people in it. And it's, it feels very limited in what kind of scope it can reach because of that. Um But the people you do meet are very nice. They're very kind, they're very helpful, they'll go other way to do things for you. But on the other hand, that's the center of the town on the outskirts of the town, there's a lot of poverty. And again, these people are very nice, but in terms of my sense of safety, there really isn't one, there is a lot of crime on the outskirts of town. And in terms of participation, it's like, like I said, there's not a whole lot to do, but you always feel welcome whenever there is something to do. So it does feel kind of like a mixed, mixed bag here. I have joined in community events. Um But it just feels like why bother. Um On the other hand, it's a kind of like the town is based on a college campus. So everything revolves around the university. And so being part of the university, you're much more able to be invited to all these different things.",31_community_online_people_group,online_community

First of all, being a part of the LGBT community in a state that is trending, uh toward, um, laws that affect us greatly. Uh For, for the worse. It gets really scary. I don't see a lot of people that remind me of myself in this neighborhood where I live. Although in the greater city, there may be more like me in the area where I am feel somewhat suburban. I don't really identify with a lot of the families that live around here. Um So I don't meet a lot of people to participate in activities with. I tend to be more of a loner when I'm out and about and things like that. I do enjoy the restaurants, the cafes, the running trail that we have near the lake here. But when I'm out and about, it's usually more just me doing that or grabbing a cup of coffee by myself or going to another part of the city to find a friend that I do have things in common with. Um, as far as a typical week in my life. I work just part time right now and I'm living here with my husband and, uh, so I usually get up early in the morning exercise again by myself. I'll work some at home. Sometimes I'll work some outside the house as a, as a ride, share driver. I'll meet interesting people, but I just don't see myself reflected in the community around me and I think that's the hardest thing about living here as far as my physical safety in this moment, I feel ok most of the time. But there are those times, especially at night where I am a little bit concerned about homophobia about crime in general. And overall, I think that I would be very happy to find uh a neighborhood and, and city and, and state for that matter, that allowed me to see more of myself in the life that I see around me.",16_social_friends_satisfied_people,social_life

Um, the politics around here are pretty awful. There is not a lot immediately surrounding and we have to go into the big city to get really the, the feel of living somewhere. I guess we're not really rural, we're not really urban. We're in this weird mix where around us is tons of housing developments going up. That leads to kind of like a, a bogey feeling of people around us. So while the school that my child goes to is right down the road, I feel like we're pretty much a lot poorer than many of the kids that are there. And I'm constantly just kind of in a weird state of wanting to provide the best for her feeling like we're not because she's not able, I guess to have as much as her peers do. Like most recent example was um, last year she went to a birthday party where they rented like a bounce house, they had tons of people there and it was like really cool. Meanwhile, I'm like, ok, so we're gonna have a party at the playground with some pizza, um, and just let the kids run around and do whatever because her birthday one is by a holiday. So that kind of stinks just in general. But then too, it's, it's just also like, you know, we're kind of falling on a budget with what we can and can't do. And it feels weird like it feels awkward going to parties. I don't feel like we are willing to engage with other parents for our kid because it's like we wouldn't fit in. We don't fit the mold because we're just slightly out of the, the Jie areas where, you know, housing is like starting in the 350,000 for brand new homes. Meanwhile, we're like kind of the redheaded stepchild where we're like off to the side pretty rural because there's farms, there's mostly mobile homes around us, like what we live in and, you know, we just don't want, we wouldn't feel comfortable with other kids coming over to our house. We don't really feel comfortable with our kiddo going elsewhere. It's just a weird state of things. We don't really have that many friends around. So it's, we stay home or we do some family activities with the kiddo or maybe with um boyfriend's grandmother, but it's just, it's kind of lonely. Don't really feel like we belong to anything nor do we really want to, I guess is the best way because we just don't feel like we'd fit in.",21_focused_task_time_project,focus

Um, go to work at some point, come home, go pick up my child from school again because even though she's 16, she does not fully have her license yet and then continue working on my hobby a little bit and more cleaning and then going to sleep if I just so happen to be able to sleep that night, which is definitely something that does not always happen.

I'm also far enough from the city to have some kind of, uh, what's the word I'm looking for privacy room. Um, and one thing that I have noticed is that the community members kind of like I shouldn't say leave you alone, but they respect your privacy and they don't really bug you too much. But at the same time they're friendly and they're there for you and, um, are happy to help if need be. Also. I like the fact that I am only 10 minutes away from the biggest, well, I shouldn't say the biggest city. I'm 10 minutes away from town. So I, if I need anything, it's only 10 minutes away.

Um, the only reason, excuse me, the only reason I didn't say strongly agree is, uh, for one, the housing prices are a little on the higher side and, um, for two, it's, it's a great city as far as finding work. Um, so raising a family in that aspect is a, a plus. But as far as the family themselves, as far as like kids and teenagers, there's really not much for them to do here besides go to school. So they, um, tend to find themselves getting into mischief, I think probably more often than in other communities. Um, and I have a 15 year old. So that's something that is really on my mind a lot.

Uh, jobs are relatively low paying and there aren't that many to, to choose from, uh, to begin with. We have kind of a, a weak job market. Uh, next, I would say that, uh, safety is an issue as well. It's not a very dangerous place. But, you know, I've lived here a long time and over the years I've been the victim of theft, uh, multiple times and there's a problem here with, with, uh, with drugs and so forth as well. That's, you know, it's a bit of a negative too. Uh, I would also say in general that the, the area is very, uh, sort of culturally conservative. Uh, and I think that's just held the area back somewhat in, in terms of just looking forward and being as, as innovative as it's needed, needed to be. I think it's just clung to the past, uh, to some extent as well. And I think kind of going along with that the area is, is very religious too, uh, and which is not by itself a problem. Same with being conservative, but it's just, I think resulted in, in misplaced priorities at times. Uh, we're not as progressive as we should be with our educational, uh, system. The county schools aren't as good as they, as they should be. We're just not making the investments in those areas that I think is needed to be done. Um, but, you know, like I said, though, I, I still feel like it's a, it's a generally good place here to, to, to raise a family. Uh, the cost of living, uh, is low, uh, certainly compared like to, to bigger cities and, and so forth. Uh, then the other issue I'd say that is, is a bit of a frustration is, uh, there's a very low walk ability here. Uh, while we do have a limited public transportation, which is actually fairly decent for an area, the size, uh, you know, to survive here, really, you have to own a car which is, which is frustrating to me. There's not, not as many sidewalks as there should be, uh, in, in that kind of thing and that's just something I've always found to be a bit frustrating.

And of course, um if you're any city that has problems with high crime and the same people who are committing the same crimes all of the time, um you don't send off your like good homeless people, you send off the worst ones and so how they work the deal.

So now robberies, car thefts, carjackings shootings are sky high here now. It's just ridiculous and stupid.

Um And every single day there's always something in the paper, you know about the crime and about what the city council is trying to do about it and all of this and it seems as if it's just one ineptitude after another. So um my solution would be to, to do exactly what Seattle is doing and export the gangs, you know, the, the homeless gangs and such as that give them an opportunity to go anywhere. But here get some of their charges dropped and get out and never come back. That would be my solution. But they don't think like I do. So anyway, um that's the condition of the community.

Um, I worked in education for 30 years and, um, in a suburb of Milwaukee and it's a community where we live is, um, a distance away from Milwaukee, but it's see if maybe 60 70,000 people. Um, again, we've enjoyed living here. Our kids went to school here. Um, there is, I guess one warehouse, our, our kids are gone and our home is really too big for us. I mean, we really do like it right now, but we just are given that we're retired, we are in the process of looking to move to kind of, to downside. I don't, I don't think we're gonna do it immediately, but I, I kind of wanna, I guess we both, you know, wanna kind of just start looking at least decide what we want to move to. So I, I could see in the next year to five years, um, in five years, I would expect we would be moving maybe a little bit after that kind of again, depending on what we're considering, um, as for the community itself. I mean, again, it was, it has been a good community. Um, it is changing. Um, the community has, is seeing an increase in crime. Um, it, it's unfortunately, um, you know, we've actually had murders which never before were the case. Um, and in part because it's kind of a community that's between a couple major cities. So it's now kind of like a drop off point, especially with the fentaNYL. We've had fentaNYL deaths and, um, parks that we would used to visit. Um, now a lot of homeless people see people shooting up. It's, it's again, kind of sad at this point. So it's definitely, um, and again, the, the area of the city where we live is, is much safer. Um, it's, um, and more on the edge, but it's just sad because we used to visit all the places in the city where now I said it's just getting a little sketchy, I guess. And I, at this point in my life, I don't really want to put up with crime. I mean, there's other places to move to. Um, I think because of policies have put in place. I, I said, I, I think kind of the deep on the police movement has spread everywhere and, um, unfortunately, the consequences of it are becoming more obvious everywhere. So, um, but again, so far we're still here, I assume we'll still live here a while. Um, and again, my typically, you know what I do in a typical week again, we're both retired. I, every day, take a walk near where I live. There's some great parks, um, or bike and hike and, and now that we're retired, my wife and I definitely do travel a lot. We have grandkids not too far from where we are in another city nearby and, and we see them at least once a week and, um, my, our other son, um, he works, he's, he's not married, but we see him at least once a week. He'll come and visit us. Um, he, he lives more like in the city of Milwaukee, so, and works downtown, um, and enjoys being there. So I said overall life is really full between, um seeing the kids and taking trips and just staying active, um, and friends and other family. So I said it's life was pretty full. Um You know, I know some people had mentioned like when you retire that you'll have less to do. I, I feel like every moment, um, is full and I would say too, as you retire, you start realizing all of a sudden different health issues come up. So just staying on top of all the health issues and, and seeing friends, it's like I said, I feel I, I'm as busy now as I ever was so, really life is good. Um But again, as far as the community, sadly, it is changing. Um, and and I said, I, when you get to a certain point you're just not gonna put up with it. I think there's a shift towards acceptance of it. Well, I mean, people can accept crime and accept drugs being done, but I don't have to live here. So, um, that's the sad part about it. I, I think again, it's, it's not that people don't want the same thing, but I think sometimes it's what we're doing, the laws we're implementing. It's, it's, it's fantasy laws and kind of like wishing for rainbows and unicorns to exist um, with these policies and they don't, unfortunately, and it's changing the community.",5_direction_want_im_life,life_direction

Um The help that I get is extremely, extremely limited in my community. And there's really no, essentially there's no support whatsoever. Um That's given towards people in my situation. It's really tough to deal with. Um I don't get and, and my cousin, meanwhile, you know, in the state of Indiana, they don't offer help for um caretakers of disabled Children.

Um, they can be upwards of 20 and up an hour, which is more than I can probably ever make at a job that would be able to tolerate my, uh, my needs. Uh, you know, my son's needs. So basically any job I work, I would have to be willing to accept the fact that I probably wouldn't have a babysitter just, um, on speed dial. And also I really don't have any family support. My mother passed away before I had a child. My father doesn't even live in a state and I really have no family in the area except for my younger brother and he's not, he's not able to, he doesn't know how to deal with Children, much less, you know, my son and his very unique needs. Um, and so basically it's just me all by myself and there's really no safety net for people like me here. There's no help. There's no, there's no day care centers for Children, like with my, like my son's uh disability, you know, there's really no, um, help for people that can help us get a break, you know, like respite care, things like that. There's really nothing like that here as far as that. And then meanwhile, I have a cousin who lives only 10 minutes away in, uh Owensboro or Henderson Kentucky. And since it's in another state. You know, it's only a few minutes drive, but she's got two twins with autism and both, um, of her twins are in their teenage years now, but she's living much better than me because of the fact, simple fact that in Kentucky they have what's called the Michelle P waiver, which it, it allows for caretakers of disabled Children to also get a paycheck every month on top of the, uh, the paycheck that the Children or, you know, that the disabled individual is able to receive every month for me. My son does get his disability check every month. But as far as I go, I don't get any help from the state for being a caretaker um of a child with the disability. So it's, it's very hard. Uh as far as community quality or my quality of life here goes now as far as everybody else, it's pretty decent quality of life.

Um, sense of safety though. Uh, it's a pretty safe community. Um, people tend to be pretty paranoid though when they see people or like vehicles they don't recognize coming through the neighborhood. Uh, but overall there really hasn't been any like significant situations as far as like crime or anything. Um, although living in Arkansas, uh, uh, there was a tornado that passed through and, uh, we were very lucky to not get hit by it.

Um I chose somewhat agree and I base that uh on several factors. Uh I'm gonna respond to the top here with your prompt. Uh with regards to sense of safety. I actually moved to the community that I now live in from Colorado. I left Colorado because it was becoming uh a very scary place to live. Uh Lots of people moved into Colorado because of the marijuana laws changing uh to where everything was legalized and a lot of them, uh ended up homeless. And so we started seeing large homeless camps and they come into the neighborhoods. Uh, they do steal. Uh, you have to worry about getting robbed. Uh, cat catalytic converters, cut off your vehicles, that sort of thing. When we came down to Texas, the area we moved into. Um, we're not seeing that sort of thing. They don't have legalized marijuana and I have not seen a lot of homeless people. Um, it's uh more of a close knit community. We have people that, um, are very poor down here. But they don't tend to rob you. Um In fact, most people help them out. Uh We have excellent Food Bank here. Uh The Tarrant County Food Bank is to be commended. Um The churches reach out and help people. You don't see people on the side of the street, uh sleeping on the sidewalks and um uh it seems like people take care of people down here. So I would say where I'm at in my current community, I feel much safer with regards to that situation, you know, up in Colorado, I didn't really worry so much about human trafficking, but down here being off of I 20 which is a major highway going into um Mexico and coming out, we see a lot of um human trafficking um stings by the state and local authorities and there's been a lot of um stories. I don't know whether they're true or not about um people trying to kidnap people out of our parking lots. Um I'm not sure how much credence to give that, but I also make sure I am situationally aware when I'm coming and going out of stores more so than I ever have been in my entire life. So that um I don't feel as safe as I once did like in the eighties and nineties and early two thousands. I don't feel like my community anywhere is as safe um with regards to well-being. Um I'm getting older so my health isn't what it once was, um, I participate more here in Texas than I did up in Colorado as far as being able to go out and do things. The cost of living is less and my income is about equal. So I have more disposable income, that sort of thing. And typically Monday through Friday we go to work or I go to work. My husband stays home. He's retired. Um, actually he's disabled and, um, uh, Saturdays and Sundays. We enjoy time with family and friends. We go out, we socially dine, we play pool, go to local music venues. Um, it's very enjoyable here. So, um, my sense of community here, I like it better than I did in Colorado simply because I do feel safer. People are friendlier and you, you feel like if you break down on the side of the road, somebody will actually stop, that'll help you instead of rob you that sort of thing.

So, you know, once again there's, there's crime and I don't think it's any worse than a lot of other areas.

Uh, but that's because we're such a small county, I believe. Um, however, community life and, and being able to take care of yourself overall in Burt County is not great. Um, there aren't a lot of services available to people. So we have a lot of homeless, uh, of folk that live there. Um, and we don't have a whole lot of, of mental health resources for people. Uh We don't have many high quality doctors in the area.

So there are things I really like about Burke County. I like some of the people I like, you know, the beauty of it, but there's a lot that I really don't like. I don't like how the politics in, in the county are. I don't like how some people have such narrow mindsets but at the same time, you know, it's home. I don't know.

And most recently, a couple of weeks ago, Um, the high school I graduated from kind of school shooting, and I think that really put the hammer to the nail about, uh, it's unsafe here.

And Arlington also has six flags, which is a popular location for sex trafficking. And so is our local mall, which obviously doesn't make me feel very safe.

And also our community is not terribly social. It used to be when we first moved here, but the Homeowners Association has basically disintegrated. And so they don't have any of the get togethers or anything that they used to have here for us.

I don't, uh, have much of a reason, you know, or a need to go out and shop or do anything really. But there's this weird balancing act between, I feel that my community would shun me, but also myself shunning myself out of the, the world around me. And the majority of people have no clue who I am or what happened. But it's always that fear of running into someone who might know.

Um, there is a decent library, but it's decent in the sense that it has, like lots of computers and lots of public programmes, but terrible for actual books and resources. Um, there is a local art museum, but it's really small. There is a local science centre, but it's for kids. There are a limited amount of concerts and whatnot that happened in the area, but to be honest, they're overpriced for the entertainment they provide. Um, there are a lot of restaurants in town, but, like 85% of them are just basic Americana food, and the rest are almost all Mexican food. There's like no real ethnic cuisines going on, and there's not a whole lot of ethnic groups. There definitely are Caucasians, African Americans and, uh, the population, Um, but they all kind of keep separate except for business wise, and it just feels like a very undecided community, like there's almost no identity of the community other than yeah, we all live here, which is it's very unsatisfying. Um, the one thing that made me move from somewhat disagree to neither green nor disagree was the fact that, uh, during the pandemic, uh, the city must have gotten, like, a whole lot of funding for, like, public parks and public parks and whatnot. And they really have expanded the park. Um, enterprise, whatever you wanna call it that this groups of parks and the ability to walk between those parks, um, and just different things to see and do, like, there's actual hiking at one of the parks now. And there's bike trails at another park, Um, and better exercise equipment at another park and things like that. So that's kind of like made it more the kind of community I want to live in because that's what I like to do is, like, walk around and see nature and do different activities at different park like venues.

I don't know anything about their lives. So that would be like on a super local level um on, in a even more general sense.

My church is 20 minutes away on a good day with no traffic and, you know, I'm close to people there, but we don't, we can't exactly hang out super often compared to somebody who lives right down the block. Like I have friends at church who live really close to each other and they're super great friends just went to the same high school, they do all sorts of stuff together and it always feels like it's more of an effort for me to participate in what I can, what I would consider as aspects of my community. Um Because yeah, there isn't really much of a sense of community here locally, like in the media, like 5 to 10 minute area. I mean, I can go to things that are for Galena Park or for Justino City, but I never truly feel part of it since, you know, we don't vote in their local elections.

You see a lot of things on the streets, especially being a student who comes back from classes late at night or from studying late at night, the later it gets into the day, the more likely it is that the community starts to morph into an environment that becomes unsafe.

There's just that people don't, don't care. I mean, they, they, they seem so self centered deal with what they want, get what they can get and do what they can do and you know, fuck everybody else in the process or stopping to help anybody or it just seems becoming such a careless society.

So that's um the main reason for you saying that I'm not satisfied with standard or like of the community I live in. Another factor is that the businesses that um uh run in the area. Um I've heard so many owners say that. Oh, we're moving. Who wants to do business in this area? And my, um, my understanding of being a business owner of community is you are part of that community. If there's something that you don't like, there's, you can catch it a bad or not good for the community, it's your responsibility to step up and help correct that problem. But these guys to correct it, they move someplace else where they think that it's a better community. Well, there's nothing wrong with the community.

You see a AAA school shooting on the news, like every other day or so it seems and I just, I, I do worry every day when I send him to school if something like that's going to happen. Um, I'm also worried about the divisiveness, uh, in this country at the moment and what that's going to lead to. I am worried about the antiscience, uh, mentality that's, that's grown over the years.

And so far I'm not in that bad of shape. So that worries me. And also the war going on in Russia sometimes not as bad now, but it used to bother me thinking we'd be under attack and everybody in the world after we just got through the pandemic and everyone in the world would be back at each other's throats and have all kinds of moral problems.

Uh my parents also, they're getting older, they're in their mid seventies now and, you know, hopefully they still have some good years ahead of them, but I recognize that, you know, 10 years from now, they may not be around and trying to prepare myself mentally for. That is something I think more and more about. I'd also say financially. Uh something I worry about too. I'm not worried about where like my next meal is coming from or paying bills, but, you know, I don't have as much money to spend as I would like to and I'm playing catch up with my retirement. I don't have nearly as much save for retirement as I'd like to. So that's on my mind more and more often. Now that I, again, now that I get a little bit older and trying to plan ahead for that, I would also say just kind of like the day to day frustrations that pop up uh unexpectedly. So, like I live in a house that's, you know, it's a little over 40 years old now and I've had to get three different things repaired in the last month. And, you know, those are un unexpected expenses that I have to, you know, stress a bit about same thing in the last week. I had a check engine light come on on my car, which was, you know, unexpected and getting that repaired costs more than I expected to. So just those kind of day to day expenses, inconveniences that are unavoidable and just pop up, you know, that's been on my mind a lot lately.

Uh Some of my largest stresses in my day to day life are um my health uh because I started having some health problems in 2021 it's really stressful dealing with doctors and insurances and the cost of it all and the time off work. And then I have to be worried about possibly losing my job because I'm missing too much work and then that cuts into, you know, income to pay the bills and that type of thing. But um ultimately, like it does come down to health and finances and trying to be able to survive when you do are faced with an illness because I live alone. Um I don't have family. I moved out when I was 15. So when things go wrong around here, I'm the only one that can, that can like get me out of the bind. Um, when I was in the hospital, I didn't even have anybody to walk my dogs. So I worry about my dogs, you know, um I worry about just simple, like sometimes I have to worry about how I'm gonna make myself some food if it's days that I'm really sick and just can't get out of bed. And those are things before 2021 I didn't really have to deal with. But even then, especially during the pandemic I was worried about my job security and finances, but even before the pandemic, um, yeah, job security. I think, you know, one or two Americans are always just, you know, a paycheck away from, you know, being destitute or homeless or that type of thing. And I thankfully am not that bad off, but it's still really frustrating when you have to decide, like, am I gonna not have groceries this week so that I can pay my electric bill and that type of stuff? So, you know, when I said, when you miss a lot of work and you have a lot of bills, uh, that you weren't expecting then and in my case, like I can't drive because of my health now. And so that's an extra cost, uh, because Ubers cost a lot more than my car costs. Um, so it's definitely, and there's just always a worry in the back of my mind about what is gonna come out of left field next because like I said, just that, you know, people want to talk about windfalls, but like I feel like a lot of bad things catch me out of left field than good things.

631,5dc483cf74939e34e55c3619,SDOH,"This question asked me to describe some things I worry about. I, I often when I see in little forms like this, you know, how, how much do you worry? I don't really worry very much. I am pretty good at accepting my situation. Uh I understand whatever the situation is out there and I don't obsess over it. Um I do say that I have a level of concern about certain health issues for me. Um, chronic health issues that, you know, I'm grappling with. Um, I'm not exactly worried about them. I know what they are. I cope with them. I try different things to overcome them or moderate them or whatever. Um, I can feel that I've got a couple of health issues that are probably will affect me a lot more. Five years down the road that worries me. Um, I have a, you know, sort of, my girlfriend's mother is in an, in an assisted living center that costs like $6500 a month. And I think of my poor mom who spent all of her money in the medical system, draining her bank account at the end, uh living in a place that cost about that much. Uh, even with long term care insurance. So I worry a little bit about that. I don't, I made a choice, bad choices, I guess, but I don't have much money. I don't know what I'm gonna do when I'm infirm, uh, if I get really sick. Um, but I'm trying to cope for some of that too. I, I'm trying to prepare, you know, buy my burial in advance not to burden my kids. But I, you know, I, I don't think I worry seems to me to be caused by, um, to be obsessed by something and not know what to do about it. And I think I just constantly try to find solutions. Um, so I'm looking more for solutions and I think there are a number of solutions that are possible. I just need to and if I don't have one now, I, I just have to think a little harder and I'll find one.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism
632,5e669db9ef9fad4172c7c086,SDOH,"So something that I worry about would probably be um lack of achieving what I'm capable of. I'm very good with, you know, a conglomeration of irrelevant things like Google searching, doing surveys, you know, talking to people. I'm very influential but not something that I could apply as a marketable skill to say, hey, wow, this guy could sell a car or hey, this guy could be an effective social media influence or hey, this guy could be a technology whiz that does like computer support and things like that. Um My current worry right now is that I've been in a long term investment with someone who means the world to me. But I wonder if my inadequacies in a lot of different ways may end up being the downfall to cause me to start all over again with somebody else or end up by myself with nothing. Um The reality is that I do challenge myself, but sometimes I do kind of give up when it gets hard. Um It's hard to wake up sometimes when you're just like, yeah, I'm mentally great today. I'm wonderful and you realize you haven't worked out in six months and you know, part of my side hustles require you to be in a certain fit condition. You don't want injury. Um You don't want things that would severely debilitate or limit your life that would basically dynamically change how you function altogether. Um I think a lot of my worries are things I can't control. Obviously, they could be mutual understanding of saying, hey, you know, everybody has second guesses, everybody worries about, you know, are you really sure you like me? Things like that. But I think I've grown up with the expectation of disappointment. So sometimes it's easier to find comfort in the fact that eventually I'm gonna make a mistake and it's just gonna bite me instead of just saying, well, you know what, today, this may actually be something wonderful that I could accomplish that is going to benefit my life for the greater. Um I worry about my job sometimes I'm good at what I do. I love it uh sincerely, but I know that it's not pushing me where I need to be. And now with everything changing in the world, I'm slowly struggling to survive. I've always been the person that had a plan B A plan C A plan D E F and now I'm stuck with one and when you fill, backed into a corner and you don't really have many people you can reach out to and ask for help. You get nervous and when you get nervous, you do irrational things like waste money and when you don't have money to waste, that's not helpful. You know. So I, I'm not the most responsible person in the world. I try my best to be on my best behavior and live a productive happy life. But sometimes I am genuinely miserable and it is hard to communicate with people about that because, you know, everybody has their own struggles and sometimes they don't want to hear what you have to say because it's the same thing you've said, you know, 30 different ways, um, prior, I guess.",5_direction_want_im_life,life_direction

Um, so I always work at least like 40 hours, but I'm really used to working overtime, like lots of overtime. And then, um I've become accustomed to like having that money and like being able to do things with it, like invest or save or whatever. So whenever my hours go back to 40 it can be like kind of stressful. Um And like, so recently I just moved into this house that we're talking about in this community and like, interest rates are really high right now. So the payment on this house is like, um much higher than I would like it to be. And now that I'm not working as much overtime, it's hard for me to like, pay extra money down on the house. And, um, so I worry about that a lot and I like, keep track of interest rates and hope that we can refinance at a better rate. Um I don't worry about too much, you know, I worry about my friends, like, as we grow up and we grow apart. Um, that's something that I worry about, like, making sure that because I'm a pretty big introvert, but I still love my friends. So, um, actually motivating myself to, like, leave the house and, um, and keep up with my friendships and my friend groups. Like, I worry about that too because it's hard for me to, like, reach out.

So I, I worry some about the more global issues like the food insecurity that uh that there are spots of that and um the climate change, I, you know, a little bit about that and politics. I'm a definitely an anti Trumper. So those are things, but they're not like the kind of worry that would, I would be sick over and they're more like things I'm just concerned about or things that I am, um, alert to.

Groceries, uh, some tripled, doubled and tripled and cost. And that, uh, creates a real hardship, especially for people, elderly and people, retired people that are on fixed incomes and just don't have, uh, the extra money to pay for this stuff. It has to come from somewhere. And, uh, so they've had to make a lot of changes, you know, they've had to cut back in areas. Sometimes they cut back in areas they don't need to like, uh, medications or, uh, you know, things that are, that are that they actually need, but they have to be able to buy the groceries and that's one of the things I worry about, uh, not, uh, too awfully much else. So, uh, I hope the economy keeps, uh, keeps it going like it's going and that could be a, you know, any downturn in that would be definitely be something that we all would worry about. And uh so we hope that that doesn't happen. We hope this inflation gets better. It's, there's signs that it's changing and turn, you know, turning around and improving.

So we are able, you know, to make ends meet and everything, but there are, of course, you know, medical bills, things that come up that cost a great deal of money that, you know, you end up having to put on credit cards and, and stuff like that, that definitely gets stressful.

It's just in a general overwhelming feeling of a um anxiety and worries about just anything that could go wrong. Um And especially with everything going on in the world today that we see a lot of unsafe things going on every day. Um It makes me worry about that a lot. Another thing I worry about is like past things I've done and past things like mistakes I've made and feel guilty about. We're all like obsessed over those things and um that kind of thing and not being able to get over it. Um So just like stuff with guilt and things like that. Um Also I worry about um losing particular relationships or friendships and the strength of those and tho those always make me worried because I know that um without them. I'm, I'm not sure how happy I would be, so, I worry about a lot of things related to that.

Um, I've always had some anxiety, uh, diagnosed and a, I worry about not being able to be there for my wife. Uh, I worry about how things affect her. I worry about how things affect her family. I don't have any family to speak of. Um, and none that I have contact with. So there's always a bit of a worry in the back of my mind that they're going to show up and that usually will entail uh, thieving from me or begging for money or fighting with me just because I won't give them money. Um, you know, things like that. I worry about the people around me, uh, who are kind of on the edge of losing their lives that they've built up due to drink or drugs or whatever. Um, we see, you know, people see easy ways to cope with drinking or drugs or whatever, gambling, stealing and it's easy to get back into those old ways of doing things and, uh, I worry that some of them will fall prey to those impulses again. Um, I, I worry that, you know, I don't make much money with what I do but it's enough to pay my bills if I live frugally. Um, I do worry that that will fall through.

645,5c0245f0a9d1ef00011816ea,SDOH,"Oh, I worry about quite a bit. Not all of it's rational but um more rational things to worry about I think are just, you know, they revolve around money and they also revolve kind of around like my own career and where it's headed and where it's not headed and like, kind of how it's, it's on me really. And I don't really know what I'm doing and I don't know how to ask for help and what it comes down to is that basically, like, it's not laziness and it's not apathy because I worry about it. But like, I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to go to college. I don't, I'm afraid of it. Like I'm terrified by the, by the prospect. So it's very hard to um kind of get that going even with like, I have an amazing partner and they would support me and help me, but it's hard to ask them for help. But, you know, also just like the long term future of like being a line cook. I mean, like my back sucks. Like I do wear a back brace at work. I am very good at my job. And so it kind of lets me minimize unnecessarily unnecessary movements. But, you know, there are plenty of people in my position, like I'm taller than average do end up with, like, bulging discs and things like that, that require surgery and my health insurance is ok. But I don't know if it would, how much it would cover. I don't know if I could. Yeah, I, I don't know what I would do if I was injured. Like, I would lose a lot of money. I most likely. But, um, you know, I guess in a larger scale I'm worried about, like, Texas is an awful state government that likes to brutalize people without power. And, like, a lot of, some of my friends fall into those categories. I worry about them. You know, I just worry about, um, we've had a couple of, like, serious weather events that kind of come out of nowhere and I do worry about those and if I'm gonna be in my home without power for a week, I do prepare for that. But, uh, you know, generally, like, I have lots of, I have lots of anxiety. I have lots of anxious and like, irrational thoughts. Yeah, most days. But, you know, it's just stuff like, oh, I think my partner who's never indicated that they wanna leave me would leave me. They're not going to. But, and, um, you know, just, most of it does revolve around money. And paying for things. Things are more expensive. Is my rent gonna increase? How high is my electricity bill gonna be this summer? Because it gets more expensive every summer. Just am I gonna be able to like, ever go anywhere? Can I like afford a vacation? Where would that be? Just everything? Is my cat gonna be? Ok? I have an older, I have an older cat but yeah, I mean, it's just my parents' health, they're getting older, it's just lot, lots and lots of stuff and not all of it, like, dominates my thoughts all the time. Just, yeah.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Um, it feels like everything is getting more expensive, um, even food. Um, it's becoming harder and harder to pay our grocery bills. We're still able to make things work. But, um, we just had to cut down a lot and really have to hunt for the best deals to make sure, uh, we can get everything that we need.

Like I'm just really worried about my future in general. Um, and I feel like my anxiety has been getting a lot worse and it, it feels like the medical care here does not really take that seriously. Um, I've tried talking to my doctor about it and they're just like, oh, well, you know, most people your age experience this kind of stress when they're, um, getting ready to graduate college and getting into, um, the, like, the big person world really. Um, so it doesn't really feel like they take that seriously. Um, and I worry that it's just gonna keep getting worse and there's nothing I can really do about it. Um, and I, I sometimes resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. So I'm worried about the effect that's gonna have on my health and my family.

I believe finances is, um, the most important thing, you know, being that I live in the United States, we're a capitalistic society. So everything is based around money. Currently, we are experiencing high inflation. Gass is high, food is high, um, everything. Um, but working wages stay the same. They don't change, they don't increase. I worry because I do not make enough money to, um, live comfortably. I make enough money to pay bills to pay my important bills, not all of my bills. Um, however, I don't, I don't live comfortably. Um, and that's my number one worry is just making sure I have enough money to be able to sustain my home. Make sure me and my family have food, my kids have clothes and all of those things. Um, I do, uh, you know, do side hustles but they only pay so much. So and then, um, having the time to even do those things. Um, being that I am a single mother, taking care of two Children and one of my Children is special needs. Um, so that does take a lot of my time as well outside of working full time. Other things that I do worry about is my Children, my children's well-being, um especially my youngest son who I stated has autism earlier. Um I worry about him the most being that he's not verbal, he's not potty trained. Um He has a lot of behavior problems and um trying to get him all the therapy he needs. Um, he went without speech therapy for nine months because I had issues with getting him social security and getting his health insurance switched over. Um Also uh getting him in a B A therapy. We have been on the waiting list for about three months now. So everything is just a waiting game for him. And my fear is, is I don't want him to um have regression where he learned something and then he stops um learning those things, you know, because it's um repetition for him when he learns things, it, it has to be consistent. So if it's not, he can regress from those things and, and that's my biggest worry. Um Other things that I worry about is my mental health. Um I get anxiety a lot. I tend to be hard on myself. Um And I do at times lack confidence. Um And I think that plays a big part in how I think and what do I think about? So I am trying to work on just being a better person um That way um that will reflect on the outside and, and I can appear more positive because I do tend to be negative a lot. Um just based on how my life has been as a child and as an adult.

649,614f3f044ab295ed97809caa,SDOH,"some things that I worry about is my, uh, legal status, Uh, in the country. I'm not yet a citizen. Neither do I have a green card. I'm working basically on a work permit. And there is a long queue for people like us to get a green card or a citizenship in the United States. So that is something that I keep worrying about. Like, what will my future look like? Right. If I look at the current queue, I might get my green card in 10, 12 years. But that is not a guarantee. It might take even more than that. So what happens to my family? My son, He's born in the US, so it's fine. He can survive. But my daughter, she was born in India and she's on a dependent visa with me. So as soon as she becomes an adult, right, and if you don't have a green card, she will go back, have to go back to India and come back on a student visa or something like that. Right? So that is what keeps me a little bit worried, right? Like, uh, is this the country that I really want my future to be Or should I move back to my own country, or should I go back to some other country? Right. Those thoughts, uh, keep coming to me, and I keep thinking about what is the best option. So if if the US government makes some, uh, changes in the way riot immigrants are treated in this country, right? Makes makes them basically, uh, has a clear part to citizenship Has a clear part to green card. It makes it easier for us. But other things that we worry about is, uh, how does the, uh, a general US community look at us, right? Like from immigrant perspective. Will they accept us? Will they, uh, treat us as, like, a family? Like sometimes we see that, uh, there is racism here, right? It's not like I've seen it in my community a lot, but outside I see that there is a racism, right. Like, uh, how is that going to impact our long term life over here?

I, I, I am not sure if I clicked accept or not and I yet I click the blue button. So I'm not sure if you're gonna get it. So there, we'll start with that. And I had made a big long monologue that was about five minutes. So, so that would be um upsetting if you don't get it. The um uh things I worry about number one, unfortunately, that has been robbing my mind is financial, financial woes and worries for years and years um since about the year 2010. Um Yeah, about the year 2010. Um I, I was living in Europe and um the money just seemed to go away. I didn't have any money anymore and um it all became a problem earning. I don't, I don't have a real um when it, when it comes down to it, I've only ever been an entrepreneur, I've only ever been on my own um solo entrepreneur. I or a partner entrepreneur.

Um, so right now I've just been striving to create some kind of, of work on my own and I've discovered that I'm, I'm terrible at it by myself that I, I, I always required another person and that person isn't in my life right now and may never be again. So because of that, um I'm, I'm floundering and everyone's everyone, you know, the whole world yells, go to school, go to school and, and yet I can't, I, I am just, it's not that I'm lazy. I I'm not that it's not that I'm non motivated, I'm extremely motivated, extremely disciplined and I work over 60 hours a week. It's the fact that uh I am, I am a little slower. I, my legs are slower, everything's slower. I mean, it's like my body was built to do one thing. I was built to be a ballet teacher and nothing else and where I live, there's just not really a um there would not be enough income derived from it. So, so I'm, I'm just here at in my house, um dealing with um trying to, to gain income. So number one is, is, is for me, is my biggest stress is to keep my house. Uh because the longer I can keep it, uh that, that means I can have some sort of, uh, a retirement. Um, right now I, I don't have any retirement because I've never ever, uh, been in a situation, uh, I, I, most of my work was outside of the United States and in, and I already collected that, um, that social security years and years ago. So, right now I'm without any social security and I'm just, uh, and I've been that way for about the last 10 years and I, I can't seem to get, go forward and gain enough to even get out of poverty status.

So, um, weighing that is a bit difficult also, um, just with academics, I would say that, um, exams are especially the most difficult challenge for me. And I usually perform well.

And then they, um, they put your electricity, your water, your trash, all that on one bill and you're not allowed to make payments if you get behind. So if you get behind, you're gonna get your electricity, your water turned off all at the same time and they'll stop picking up your trash. So, thankfully that hasn't happened to us, but our utility bills are astronomical. I don't know why. Maybe it's my son's but they're anywhere from 250 to 400 something dollars a month on top of our rent. So, you know, and you, like I said, you can't make payments on it.

So, yeah, I would say definitely one of my big stressors is um worrying about getting the utilities paid every month, but we, we do make it happen. We haven't had them shut off.

So, a lot of my sleepless nights were because I was unemployed and I was trying to find a job and at 60 years old, it's a bit more difficult to, uh, get in front of somebody and be able to convince them that you're not gonna retire in two years. Um I had enough in my savings to get us to get me through for a while and I did finally land a job. But now, you know, I worry a bit about starting this new job, feeling comfortable with this new job, getting a good handle on it, it's in the industry that I've never worked in before. So there's definitely a learning curve and replacing my savings in case something ever happens again. I went through all of our, my savings. Um, we, you know, we built a life based on the income that we both had over the years and then to have all of that just end when I lost my job of 25 years. That was a bit hard, a hard pill to swallow and hard to come back from. Um, so, yeah, I do stress about money. I stress about my Children.

Um, they are both still alive getting up there in age, um, and worry that, you know, sometime soon they will, they'll have some health issues that will, will stop them and slow them down and make it to where, you know, they can't get around and do things for themselves. Uh, I have a couple of kids. I worry about not so much but, you know, they're adults, they take care of themselves but, you know, as a parent you, you always worry, um, I worry about the economy in this country. I worry about the elections, um, whether or not they're currently fair and, or rigged. Um, I believe that things have been done that have, may have compromised our election integrity. Certainly hoping that's not the case we are. I worry about I don't worry about a whole lot. Um, the future of this country is probably, aside from my family members, the future of my country is probably my biggest worry, um, between illegal, illegal immigrants and the clowns that are wrecking the economy in Washington DC right now.

So money would definitely be the biggest stress in my life. Um, I only work part time so that makes it kind of hard to make enough money. So I have to definitely make things stretch and working so much. I don't have time to do anything else. So that's another thing that I worry about not being able to be there and just always being tired from working so much I feel like is very stressful.

And growing up, one thing I learned early is if I can't control it, I shouldn't be worrying about it too much. I know it can impact my life, but there's not much I can do about it. So just focus on what I can control and go from there. Um, recently, the one thing, the biggest worry though is, uh, I worry about my dad. Uh, my mother passed away three weeks ago last Thursday and my parents were married for over 40 years. So this is the first time in my dad's life that he's been living alone and I've gotten more text messages and calls from him in the last 23 days. Now. I think it is that sometimes I do in like two years. Um, he's not a big texter, he's not a big caller and I can tell it's impacted him a lot. So I worry about him and I try to reach out for him more. We've got up to see him a lot more often. Uh, than we normally do just to check on him, make sure he's doing well and he's doing the same thing for us as well. But, um, that's my biggest worry is, you know, he just, he gets lonely, he'll have too much time on his hands and he doesn't have that companionship. And other than me and my brothers going up to see him, he doesn't really have that because family, you know, lives four or five hours away. That's, uh, not myself or my brothers.

So I've been worrying in that aspect because I'm trying to get myself in the position to buy a house.

But other than that I try not to let myself worry too much because there's just some things that you can't control. Um, so as far as, um, what I do worry about that seems to be it health kids in money. Which probably are the three major ones for anybody. Um, um, especially when, you know, you do a lot of work from home stuff. The work isn't always there for you and they do have one child who's, um, on disability, um, for his autism.

So, um, I could worry about that very much. So, but at the same time, why worry about it, what will be, will be right the way I see it personally is that, you know, things happen for a reason and I shouldn't stress myself out about future events that haven't happened yet. Seems like a good way to invite stress into your life to pull it towards you. So, no, I worry about things that are in front of me right now. As of today, there's nothing in front of me. It's a beautiful Saturday day, Saturday. The weather is cool and warm, really nothing to worry about right now.

My father is gonna be 77 next week and he's part of the vulnerable category. He has, he's immunocompromise.

So when the people are walking around, especially down here in Texas, the people tend not to wear their mask when they don't wear their mask. When people sneeze around me, when they cough around me. I worry that I'll be bringing this virus to my father. So I've been vaccinated, I've been boosted up, but I always, sometimes I worry about that.

Um, I have a few things maybe in the past that I need to work on as far as dealing with, but I don't think it affects me too much in the present. But thinking about the future is very stressful because it's so much uncertainty. You don't know what's gonna happen and you really don't know who to trust. There's so much going on in the world, you don't know how somebody else's decisions are going to affect you in ways that you haven't even thought of. So that's one of the things that worries me a bunch. I do have some stress when it comes to personal relationships. But, you know, it's nothing that you can't fix because it's directly dealing with either one or a few people. So it's easier to maintain rather than like global issues that could affect you or things like that. So the future is very worrisome to me. I would say that's what I have a problem dealing with the most because I really don't understand what's gonna happen. And the fact that I know I won't understand until it happens, that's fearful to me. But other than that, I think a lot of other things are manageable if you really get down and think about it.

He's married and he's got five Children and I worry about them being able to provide for everybody and, uh, keep a roof over their head. Um, we just found out today that they are moving into a house, a nice three bedroom house. So, yeah. Um, but I, I'm worried about that a lot. Um, honestly he went to prison for 3.5 years and is out on parole. He's doing great. It has been for the last couple of years, but I worry about him messing up or doing something that's, uh, gonna cause him to go back. That's, that's a big fear, big fear.

Um, I'm 53 extremely overweight and just trying to have diabetes and, you know, a little bad back, all that kind of stuff. Um, so, I mean, I worry how everything is gonna be as I get older. Um, I guess I'm, I've just faced my mortality and, uh, you know, I worry about that. Um, I worry about being able to put enough food on my own table. Um, you know, you get, I, I'm on s si social security income and they just upped that like, I think about 80 bucks, $80 but in turn, they turned around and lower my food stamp is down to 100 and $27 a month.

So I know that it starts at home. So we kind of have that front taken care of. But as far as his, his education at school and being able to go to university, um, I was lucky enough to get a full ride because I studied my butt off and got a scholarship. But nowadays it's not even enough to pay for college because it's so expensive. So I worry about not having enough money saved up by the time that he's 18 so that he could go to whichever university he wants to go to. I don't want to leave him in crippling death, crippling death, death. My God, I can't even speak. Um, but I do worry about that. I worry about his safety at school just because there's so many mass shootings happening and every day, um, I worry about our safety driving just because everybody drives so recklessly. Um, and one of the things always I worry about is our finances even though we generate more than $200,000 a year I still worry about. Are we gonna have enough, you know, to save up for our retirement? Because again, growing up in the kind of area that I did, everybody was broken, broke and they never saved for anything. And they basically made their kids their 401k and I don't want to do that to my child. I don't think that it's fair that, you know, you raise this, this, these Children to take care of you. At the end of the day, you should be responsible for yourself. You're a grown adult. They, you know, let them live their lives and be happy and not have to worry about you in your old age. But they might have to do a lot with the Mexican culture that we come from where I see like my grandparents never took care of anything. They never saved any money. So then they expect their Children to take care of everybody. I'm an only child and my parents got divorced when they're after 37 years of marriage. So I am financially responsible for my mom. So I always worry about her getting sick and not being able to have enough money to take care of her. Luckily she'll be getting her social security pretty soon, so she'll at least have that. But when my dad divorced her, he left her with nothing. So it's just having to make sure that I take care of her. And so I always worry about making money and making enough money for everyone because even though my husband does work full time, I worry about him quitting his job just because he's so unhappy because he works so many hours. It's so hard at the job that he does. But at the same time, my job is great and it's very flexible. But they notice that I work really hard and they want to give me more work yet not compensate me for it. So, right now I'm worried about that because I did ask for a raise and I know my boss is working on it, but it doesn't seem like it's gonna go well. And they've been cutting jobs and like, they probably fired at least 6% of the people at our company, which I know doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of people when you're in such a big company.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Um, lately, work had reduced my hours, so I had to look for other side gigs to do, and because of that, they didn't give us any notice. It was just like one month and projects were taken away. So my paycheck was like, cut in half. So I didn't have enough for my bills. And I was late on my on my OK, my main bill, other bills. I was OK. The main bill that I was late on was on my my rent, like I paid part of it and stuff like that. And so what stresses me out is money because to be honest, I hate I hate poverty. I hate being broke. I hate not having enough. So lately I have been I've been working really hard on multiple. I have. I've been working hard to create multiple streams of income, so I I've been for which is why I haven't really had a social life because I've been working a lot to try and bring everything together before I two years before. I used to have a great social life because my one job used to provide for me sufficiently so I didn't have to look for other side gigs When my job, uh, when I was taking a break from my main job, I would just relax and spend time with my friends. But now, because my main job cut our hours, um, by almost half when I'm taking a break from my main job, I am working other side jobs, which does not leave a lot of time for social activities. So my main worry is money. I want to have enough for my bills and everything, and I want to have money left over for me to invest money left over for me to create an emergency fund like um, the past two years. If there's anything that I've learned is an emergency fund is dire, it's essential. It's something that everybody needs to have because life is unpredictable. You don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. So that's what scares me. Uh, financial. I wanna create we wealth, and that scares me a lot because I don't want to fail at that task because I want to create a legacy for myself for my Children's Children's Children's Children. I want to be able to leave something on this earth, Um, that generations that follow me can can can use, you know, and being a person of colour. We haven't really we we we haven't really been taught that or we were never given that opportunity to live in wealth for our for future, for future generations. And because of that, we had to start further back from other races or because they had. They had generational wealth. We didn't have generational wealth, so we had to start from the bottom. So I don't want the generations that follow me or my Children and their Children and all those those generations that will follow me to also go through through the same thing, because now I have the knowledge. Knowledge is sparing is everywhere. So now I know how to create generational wealth. There's no reason why I shouldn't be creating it.

Um The plans that we had have kind of shifted and changed over the last six months and now, instead of, you know, transitioning to another field altogether or another job or anything like that, I will be taking on a completely different role.

Um I've had kids who threatened to throw things at me or made jokes like they were going to hit me or hurt me.

So I, I worry about all of that. Um So you're just daily going to work. I worry um about my own safety, about my mental health um about my physical health ex especially um you know, I'm worried about the way the economy seems to be going. I'm worried about, you know, the general health and well being of my son. It's hard being a parent wondering constantly if every choice you make is the one that, you know, is gonna like dramatize your kid forever.

This is especially concerning during a pandemic, as the possibility of exposure is higher. Besides, the emotional impact of the job can be a source of concern. As a nurse, I often see patients and families dealing with challenging and emotional circumstances, which can be difficult to handle. Therefore, I must prioritise my mental health to deliver the best care possible. Finally, job security and financial stability are concerns that come with any profession.

So it gives workers uh more flexibility and how they want to work who they want to work for. But most of that work is 10 99. So you have to pay taxes at the end of the year and my husband doesn't really like that way of working because he, he, he feels like he doesn't want to owe the government money. So a lot of the work that I'm able to pick up that's flexible and pay as well and makes me feel comfortable and less anxious is a work that he doesn't really like um because it is in tax.

I'm usually not sick and I'm trying to be slightly more healthy than I was. So there's that, but my parents are getting older and they both have a chronic health issues.

So I'm reliant on my parents and other sources for income or not income. I make my own money. But, uh, they, they're responsible for cost of living and stuff.

Um, and I'll always be safe here, but I do worry um, about the job market that I'm gonna be entering, um, that things like A I and technological development are definitely going to severely impact my employment opportunities. And then beyond that, I also worry about how I'm gonna stay connected to friends and people of my age. Um I've definitely lost a lot of friendships just by moving away to go to school. Um, and then when I'm living here with my parents, like I am right now, um, I, it's, it's much more difficult to stay in contact with friends in other places. Um, so I have a lot of friends, for example, who live in places like New York City or Boston. Um, and they're just living very, very different lives than the one that I'm living here. Um, so it's hard to stay connected just in terms of like scheduling. Um, and what each of us are doing at any particular point in time.

I'm a flight attendant and in your first few years, you know, you're not making very much and then you get a huge pay increase about year four or five. So right now, while I'm able to afford rent in a decent apartment in Houston, it would pretty much almost deplete one of my paychecks. So I feel like it's foolish to move out. So right now I'm living um with my parents. So I sometimes I end up spending too much money when I'm out with my friends because you know, they have better jobs. So you wanna stay out and hang out so you end up spending too much. Um So which has put me in a really bad credit card debt, but I created a budget um a few months ago and now I'm back on track because I realized I was overspending and, you know, now I'm back on track of knowing what I need to spend and how much I need to work to make sure I get, I have a, an enough money for the month. Another thing I worry about is romantic relationships. I have been through the, the two very bad relationships and my last two, um, you know, it's been really hard. Uh, my last one was devastating and I'm at the point now where, you know, I don't even really wanna date because I can't risk like being fooled like that again and having my heart broken. So I do worry like, you know, am I ever gonna get married? I'm ever gonna meet somebody. But at the same time, it's just like I don't really want to even try to get to know anybody because is not going to work. If you get on a dating app, they're insane. They are literally insane. Um, people lie about their age, they lie about everything and you meet up with them and they're just a completely different person or they expect something that you're not willing to give. So it's been hard doing that. Um, probably one of the most pressing things that I've worried about is my aging parents. Um, my parents are a little bit older for, for to have a kid my age, but my dad has been on dialysis. So I was very worried about his health and my mom, she's retired now, but she's been having some memory issues, which is a little bit concerning.

I am gonna reach out to like more jobs and more positions offered that I wasn't offered before.

Was that really worth it? Should have done it? And, you know, I guess on the same note, I know that these things take time. Um, so it's not an immediate, I will be in the tech industry and I know now, you know, this is the time where a lot of tech layoffs are occurring. So I also keep that in mind. So it's just a worry that I guess too that with that is the tech industry going to, um, start hiring again, hire less. I mean, which positions are gonna be more prioritized above others. And so it's just kind of a conflict of, should I study something else? Should I study this on top of having the certificate? Should I just really, um, be like a subject matter expert in just this one category. Should I just really go in on sequel and really, really learn sequel? Is that gonna be something that's not needed as much since now. There's Chat GP T chat GP T four and it's just technology is just constantly, constantly going. That is kind of like which direction is tech going. So I can study that path or focus on that path or what should be my path.

And for context, I grew up in poverty, I grew up going to a school system that was 89% black and I'm a white person. And so I was always the minority. Um I even have AAA kid in, in middle school, set my hair on fire literally with a match um because he hated white people. And yet I, I just always believed in this country that no matter what, no matter where you came from, if you just worked really hard enough and you had the intellect and the abilities and just kept persevering that you could have a place and that you could actually excel and granted I have a shit ton of student loan debts. So I worry about that, worry that the fact that we'll bail out conglomerates and businesses and everything else and we'll bail out Ukraine, but we won't help our own folks here. Um But that's an aside, but you know, I, I worry about that there is this belief now that almost like America is the worst place on earth, our politicians, even if you look at what happened just recently in Nashville with, um, the trans person that shot those kids and three adults. But yet we're making it out that the trans people are victimized and calling. I think even yesterday at the White House, they said, you know, we're gonna fight this, we're gonna fight this and, and I think a lot of the words and things that we see in the media now we're constantly pitting people against each other versus trying to collectively solve problems. You know, I mentioned my upbringing just to give some insight that, you know, I, I, I've mentioned before, I've done quite well in life and not without a lot of debt and not without a lot of other kinds of things that have happened. But I never even once looked at people as, oh gosh, I don't want to be around those people because, you know, black people clearly must hate white people. Um, or, oh, you know, I don't really, really want to be around a Muslim because surely that must mean they're a terrorist and yet what we are seeing today in, if you look at things like social media and even even some of the words that come out from the former president and the current president, his administration, it's not about trying to solve things together. It is about pitting people against each other. And there's a saying about when this man slow to anger balls up his fist, you know, basically, you should look out. I think we're getting to a point in this country where so many people are suffering. And I would argue their idea of suffering is still kind of. Um I remember as I, I remember when I was growing up and my grandmother used to be like, we're so poor and we're so not blessed by God and we're struggling so much. And I used to be like, your life is still better. Like our life is still a million times better than someone living in the slums of Delhi. And there's not kind of this, this respect to understand that, you know, yes, some things can be bad. But what are you doing to change it? What are you doing to take some accountability for it? So I, I see that there's been this silencing of even having, you know, what I would perceive as free speech. You can't have certain nuanced conversations without someone being like, you're a racist, you're fascist, you're a Nazi, you're transphobic, you're a misogynist, you're anti feminism. And that level of discourse to me is far more detrimental than anything that's going on in this country right now. Um One of my favorite books growing up was 1984. I, I loved dystopian literature. Brave new world, all that good stuff. And when I see some of the things that happen now, I feel like, oh my God, we are slowly sliding down into something similar to 1984 where even the very word meaning of words and, and what they intend and how, if you say something that someone doesn't agree with, it's almost like you're committing violence. I feel like that's gonna take us down to a place where no one in this country is really prepared to face. That's my greatest concern. I, I have lived abroad.

780,5d3df9b23bf3780015abf56f,SDOH,"Um, some things I worry about that is such a broad question or a prompt, I guess. Um, for me, I would say a lot of what we've already discussed just in terms of accessing services, um, being able to afford basic necessities. Obviously, with the, um, rise in inflation, everything's outrageous uh in price. I think it's worse here. I know it's worse here because we live in a rural community. So there's no other options. You know, you're stuck paying $5 for a gallon of milk unless you drive 30 minutes away to a bigger city where you can get it for less than $3. So, yeah, definitely. Inflation is a big stressor for me right now. Um, I graduated from college a couple of years ago and because I don't have transportation currently, um, I haven't been able to find uh stable employment. Um, I would love to go back to grad school or go to grad school and finish with my bachelor's would love to go to grad school. Um, but because of uh, student loans, that's definitely a stressor. I feel like the, um, it's, it's kind of back and forth because you know, you hear about student loan forgiveness. I'm in the camp that I would qualify for the full amount for the 20,000. And that would be such a heavy burden lift off my shoulders if that was forgiven. And obviously I would be able to, you know, continue my education and hopefully be able to make gains in that area too. Um, but because of, you know, the back and forth, will it happen, Won't it happen? It's all been very stressful. Um, and also, you know, the, the prospect of those, uh, loans resuming or the repayment of those loans resuming. Um, again, uh, when I graduated from college, they were already paused because of the pandemic. So that's something that I never faced. And as someone who's kind of struggling to make instant meet as it is. Um, yeah, I, I can't imagine having to repay student loans on top of that right now. Um, otherwise I would say some of my biggest stressors are just, um, health related. Personally. I'm in pretty good health. I really need to get my wisdom teeth out. Um, and that's not covered by my insurance and it's, you know, a few $1000 out of pocket. I can't afford that. So I'll just, you know, continue taking over the counter pain medicine and hope for the best. But I know that, um, one of my parents needs some, some significant uh medical treatments done and again, not covered by insurance. You have to go pretty far away to access those services. It's dental care for them as well. Um, so just being able to do all that and then also help them navigate, um, through those systems and be able to, uh, to even get to those appointments. Because for like oral surgery, you have to be able to go to a dentist and even just getting to a dentist around here can be a hassle. So getting to the dentist, getting that, uh, referral to the oral surgeon then actually, uh, you know, going through that entire process has been a big stress for me personally. Um, no, overall, I think a lot of it is just finance related and health related. Um, but, you know, I guess things have been worse.

So I do want to go quickly over that and recap what I said on that question just in case. Um I did feel like that it is difficult for people to participate in the community. Uh As far as, you know, I felt like it's easy for people to volunteer to help the community, but it's hard for people that are in need to receive help from the community back. Um There's a lot of people that are not getting the help they need in this community. Um And so that's basically what I touched on in the previous question. Um Now, as far as things, some this question, some things that I worry about. Uh Well, I worry about who would take care of my son if, if anything were to happen to me. Um He has autism and he's six years old and his communication is quite limited. Um And so I just worry about who would, who would be able to take care of him, you know. Um Another thing I worry about is, um let's see if I'll ever be able to get a job in my career choice and my dreams. I am, I have an associates degree in accounting, but due to my son's needs, I'm not really able to work in that, um, type of, of setting because, um, as far as I'm aware, no real professional job would probably ever allow a person to work with them 9 to 5 and, and then tolerate any school, you know, vacations and breaks and all that because I don't really have anybody who could watch my son for spring break fall break. Christmas break. Um, you know, Easter Break or, or, or any of the school like Martin Luther King Day, President's Day, whatever, all days they have off over summer break. I just don't wanna have anybody who could watch my son or even understand how to the, the nuances of taking care of my son, um, in depth like I do. Um, and also there's another thing as far as a babysitter that worries me is my son can't really communicate very well. Right now he's, he's largely, he's largely nonverbal, I guess you would say he says a very limited words. So if somebody who were treating my son wrong or bad, I wouldn't have any real way to know he wouldn't be able to tell me necessarily. And so that's not, that's also something I would worry about and do worry about. Um, I worry about, you know, what's going on with his school because at home I've been seeing him doing better than ever and school is something he used to always love. But now lately every single day I've been seeing his daily report after school from his teacher and it's saying terrible things about him having, you know, meltdowns constantly just refusing to do the work out. Right. Um, taking things that don't belong to him. Uh, let's see, putting hands on other students was one from the other day, uh, laying on the floor and just screaming and having tantrums and redirected. These are all things that are really terrifying to me because I don't understand what's going on and I don't see what's happening to trigger that in school. I don't ever experience that here. So it's kind of been shaking me up a little bit. Uh, let's see. I worry about, uh, I worry about if anything were to ever happen in my car, which is my only means of transportation and it's vital for my son to get to his therapy, his autism therapy.

There are certainly things that are vulnerable that are said, but the right to say them not to agree with them necessarily, but to allow people to say them is essential. You don't need freedom of speech for things that are popular. And along with that comes the fact that we have become seemingly unable to work together to reach mutual solutions to problems that we all face uh teach economics.

Um And so that kind of gives me a little bit of worry. Um I think that with some work I can get there and sort of catch back up in a sense.

Um Another thing that worries me a little in a broader sense is like the political climate and economic climate and the actual climate for, like being maintained for the future for people. Like my son, like, I want to make sure that we don't screw it up now for the people coming after us and uh we're gonna run the country after the people running it now.

Um when we focus on the, the things that are more, more present, uh the Coronavirus still, still worries me greatly. I mean, especially now that the um federal government is no longer really subsidizing uh vaccines anymore. I believe that stops pretty much around the, the beginning of 2023. And so that means, you know, any new variants uh that come out, people who don't have insurance won't be able to easily get a vaccine for those new variants. And I mean, especially with uh pharmaceutical companies already committing to jacking up the price of the uh the vaccine that the vaccines that do exist. Uh Let's see, there's uh what also monkey pox that that's been in the, in the community. And I, I believe that's making a comeback now. Uh So it's like it was kind of going away a bit and now it's uh it's roaring back to life, I think. So. That worries me as well. Uh The, the state of, of, of our democracy worries me quite a bit. You know, it's, uh, can't, can't seem to go a day without hearing something in the news. That is, is absolutely frightening. I mean, for example, uh, you know, Tennessee just got finished ousting two of their young black, um, state leaders. I don't, I don't remember which part of the legislative branch that they're, that they're in, but they're in, in one, in one of the, the state legis legislative branches in Tennessee and they just got finished getting rid of them because they didn't like the fact that they decided to, uh, hold a little protest on the floor because Tennessee was refusing other Tennessee legislature, legislators were refusing to even discuss the possibility of, of having gun legislation after they just had a school shooting. You know, which is another thing that worries me. It's like every, what it, every, every couple of weeks, few weeks, several times a month, there's another school shooting in the country and all, uh, all politicians, uh, do is offer their thoughts and prayers if they're, if they're conservative and, uh, make empty promises of tackling gun reform if they're, if they're liberals, but nothing ever happens and everything stays exactly the same. Uh, you know, except for the, the fact that in many, in quite a few states, uh, that are conservative, it's going the exact opposite where, instead of having tighter gun control in, in the face of all these, uh, mass shootings that we experience in this country, every single year. Uh, Republican controlled states are actually making it easier to have guns and making it easier to, uh, bring your guns with you wherever you want to, uh, such as in Florida where they went. And, uh, what, what did, what did they do? I think they got rid of, um, restrictions or at least lessen them greatly. Uh, that, that stopped most people from being able to just open carry handguns wherever they want. You know. Now they're like, yeah, no, no, go ahead. Everyone can go ahead and do that. So that worries me. And I mean, I do live in North Carolina. So, I mean, the, the simple one thing that worries me more locally is that now the, um, republican controlled legislator has a super majority because one of the, the Democrats, uh who just recently got elected, decided that she was going to switch over to becoming a Republican and they were only one seat away from having a super majority. So, like, yay for anyone who's not conservative, I guess. And, uh, let's see, also speaking more locally. There, there's also the fact that our, our state Supreme Court is. Uh, wow. I, I forget what the exact number is. I think it's 5 to 2, uh, with conservative justices on our state Supreme court and that's going to be like that for the next decade. And they've already completely broken precedent by deciding that they're just gonna go back and pretty much like rehear cases that have already been decided that they didn't like the outcome of. So, I mean, things that happened, uh, last year that they, that they don't think should have happened.

You worry about whether the government's going to interfere with our ability to live our lives as we see fit. These are, these are all big concerns for us just like they are for other people. Um, basically I really can't think of anything else that I worry too much about. Um, generally, I mean, you know, it just, it's the things like recently our car went out, uh, the transmission went out in the car, our older car, we just bought one when we had our third baby of less than a year ago. And so we bought one that was larger, a minivan so that we could all fit in it. And the old uh crossover S U V that we had, uh for six years had the, the transmission had gone out of it. And we've put so many miles on it with my husband's extensive commuting that we're not really sure if it's going to be worth it to fix it at this point. So we're maybe back down to one car. And right now the prices of cars are insanely, uh, inflated and disproportionate to anything even remotely like what a car price should be. So, I mean, we're pretty concerned about that. You know, we always are concerned about things like, you know, what if something horrible happens, like in our last house, we had to have, we had water damage from, um, air conditioning ducts leaking and it cost us about $20,000 to fix all of it. And it was, you know, everybody worries about those catastrophic sort of home repairs or car repairs and can I afford, you know, the essentials to get me to and from work? You know, can I afford to fix my house if something goes terribly wrong? Most people don't have a tremendous amount of savings right now.

For example, we were using the last of the mustard and I was anxious about it. I was keeping an eye on it because I was worried about when we would need to replace the mustard. Not that we wouldn't be able to afford new mustard. It was just that worry about it. Us needing a new one in the fridge. When would we need it? Um So I don't know if I'm the best person to be answering this question about worry, but I worry about a lot of things that probably I shouldn't worry about. I worry about things that I should be worrying about. Um, money is always one of those things who doesn't worry about money. There's not many of us. I worry about my daughter. I worry that I am. I'm not a good enough mother to her. Uh, I worry that I'm gonna mess her up because I'm, I don't know how to parent.

I, I did say, you know, rarely, I'm, I'm gonna say, you know, I don't think anybody is no stress, but I try to make my life that way and not worry too much. So things that I, I have had to worry about this in, in the past month, you know, I had to, I had a uh relative of mine passed away. And so, you know, that was a little bit of stressful and a little bit of worry what was going on and then at around the same time, uh we had some people in our household get sick with the flu so that just kind of added to that and, and, you know, I, we were worried, you know, because we didn't want to get anybody else sick that was involved in, in services there. So, um but, you know, that that caused some stress and worry recently in my life. But other things that I worry about sometimes is just, you know, um with, with inflation uh being strong recently, you know, everything's costing more and while we do have enough money to afford stuff, I, I'm, you know, haven't had trouble buying groceries or anything like that, but since I do cost more I haven't been able to save as much as I would like to normally. So it's a little concerning just thinking about the future and retirement and paying for college and stuff like that. Now, granted, I've still got a ways to go on that yet, but it'll be here sooner than, than, you know, if I don't, if I don't do anything, it'll be on me in, in surprise. Right. So, um, and that's one of my biggest worries is just not, not saving enough at the moment. So, yeah, I'm making enough money to, to live comfortably, you know, if, if some unexpected expense comes up I can cover it. But it's like, yeah, health care and groceries, a pretty big chunk of my paycheck. Uh, both those items. We've got some chronic conditions that I, you know, do worry about, but we've got those managed but they do cost a bit of money. So I think, I think those are kind of the biggest, uh, think concerns just relating back into the, the finances and just, you know, um, am I saving enough and, and, you know, making, trying to, trying to get on that train and figure out ways that we can trim things in the budget so that so that we can, uh, you know, make sure that we're financially secure in the future.

I never have recovered and I suffer long COVID during 2020 oh nine months after I got COVID, November of 2020 my appendix ruptured and I suffered with it for four weeks. I was scared to go to the hospital. I was scared because of COVID. I was scared because I didn't know how I was gonna pay for it because my attorney was bullying me for the company. My, my union attorney was bullying me for the company to get me to let them off the hook and accept the settlement offer, which was really not much at all wasn't enough to where I don't have money today. So and I'll never be the same. I have a neck injury and shoulder injuries and carpal tunnel bilateral. So my hands fall asleep, my shoulder blades were not a problem until I got cortisone shots as per their treatment. And that caused me a bad reaction and I had severe pins and needles in my shoulder blades and I still do if I overdo it. So now I live a very sedentary lifestyle. I went from a very active lifestyle. I worked out, I had a heavy workout five days a week, 4 to 5 hours a day. I was very healthy, very fit. And now I am not and I don't do not even a fraction of the physical work that I, I did. Not, not even, not even, ah, so anyhow, getting back to my appendix because I was being bullied and I, I woke up and I didn't feel well, but I really didn't think it was my appendix. But four weeks later I decided I am not getting any better. I lost £20. I can't eat. I have a lot of pain. Now it's gravitated down to the right lower side of my abdomen. And I think I need to go to the emergency room. I can't, I can't keep putting this off and praying that I'm gonna wake up and feel better. And I went and I ended up having to get on Medicaid because I signed off and I gave to the company the day before I went to the hospital, I went to December 30th of 2020. I woke up. No, no, 29th. I'm sorry, December 29th. I woke up November 30th with the pain. So I went that long and my surgeon said that he thought my appendix had ruptured probably a week before I went into the hospital, but it was encapsulated. I had to be hospitalized, had to have a pick line and a drain bag and did not get to go back to have surgery until March. And I saw the pictures of what the inside of my body looked like the day of surgery and I was still very infected looking.

I'd like to finish that and get an associate of science and accounting degree. And of course, you know, it's the typical. Oh, no. You know what if I'm a smart person, I used to have honors classes throughout middle school and high school. So, but, you know, you're still concerned, can I? Oh, no, can I, can I do this? Um You know, can I find a part, some kind of part time job I can do at home because it's hard for me to get out because of the way my body feels. There's a lot of things to think about. Um And there's a lot of things, negative things going on in the world. And so you wonder, am I wasting my time? Kind of just uncertain on what to do? Um just uncertain. But my main concern right now, my main uh I, I if you wanna say worry is bringing in enough extra money to be able to continue to have my little apartment and pay my bills. I pay my bills first if I eat, I eat and I haven't had a problem with food. I'm just saying my concern is I have to have a roof over my head and that includes paying rent and all my bills first.

Um I worry about my cats. I have two cats. I worry about their health and what's going on with them. I worry about, you know, them aging, them getting older. I worry about my health as well. I mean, not only just theirs but I definitely do have a high regard of health anxiety. Um When I'm laying in bed trying to sleep at night, I'll be thinking, you know, my tooth kind of hurts, maybe it's falling out or my head hurts, maybe it's a tumor. Um, these things will just like intrusive thoughts that won't leave. Um, but financial would definitely be the biggest thing that racks my brain and keeps me up. Um, trying to think of how I'm gonna get enough money to, uh, contribute. Um, my fiance still has a job and he was the financial, he was already bringing in our main source of income, most of our income. So me losing my job wasn't, obviously um like a full blow. It didn't take us down completely, but it definitely has hurt. And even before then I was stressed about the amount of money I was bringing in. So it's definitely only increased and trying to feel like I'm bringing enough to the table to, you know, be on an equal plane as him and pay our bills and pay especially the bills that are mine like uh my student loan um bills particularly I feel bad that not being able to pay myself and asking for that support from him.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Um, I have a hard time keeping up with it and I have to do a lot of work at home and there's a lot of distractions at home and it takes me a really long time to get through the work I need to get done and that stresses me out. Um, money stresses me out. I don't like if I need some money here and there, I can ask my parents and they can give me 100 bucks once in a while maybe, but they cannot fully support me and I have bills to pay and I was working and going to school for a while and that was way too much. I found um because I aged out of like FA F S A needing my parents tax info. F F S A actually gave me money because I am poor, um poor enough that I needed that money. But whenever I was younger I, I had to put my parents' tax info whether or not they were actually supporting me. Um, so I was able to get a Pell grant and some student loans, which sucks that I'll have to pay them back. But at least I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands of debt. Um, just a, maybe just under 20 K, like, like 15 or so. Um, but I still, I get that in like a lump sum. You know, I have benefits that pay my tuition hours. So I don't have to put a lot of it towards school, but like some of it pays the extra fees that tuition, my other benefits don't cover and then my textbooks and any supplies that I need. And then the rest of it I have to use for housing transportation, stuff like that. I use it for the things that we're allowed to use it for. So I buy groceries and I split groceries with my fiance, but a lot of times they don't get paid at the right time and for a while they weren't making enough money and I've had to cover their ass more times than I would like. And it stresses me out because I have to make my money last and it's getting harder and harder and they have a new job and they're making more money and they say they're gonna pay me back.

Um Even though I answered no to most of the financial concern questions in the last section, that's um largely because I currently live with family.

As at the moment, um partially due to disability related reasons, I'm also going to be applying for disability and that's um like disability payments from S si and that's um quite a process. So I'm not looking forward to that. Um And then just, you know, related work itself. Um I'm self employed part time. Um So I always feel like I could be doing more. Um I worry about decisions I make with my projects, I worry about which projects to take on. I worry about if I've taken on too much or too little. Um worry about meeting my goals. Um I think about that kind of thing a lot. Um So work money, um creative stuff. Um Well, both the practically and the creative stuff like those things occupy my mind a lot. And um yeah, kind of, I would say most of my stress comes from that from there. Um, in terms of other concerns. Um, well, I worry, I do worry about, um, since I was thinking about this and there was some questions about medical stuff. Um, well, I'm trans and I'm medically transitioning, so I have got some surgeries and stuff coming up and, um, I worry about, uh, both of that because, you know, even, um, even when you want it, it's still a scary process to go through and then, um I do worry about being able to get to appointments because, you know, in the community where I live, they don't have that. So I have to commute to Seattle. Um And because of my disability, I actually can't drive. Um So it's really hard to get there. Um Yeah, and so that's stressful in itself and then, you know, I can't lose my health insurance, um which I have through Medicaid. Um So I always worry if something's gonna go wrong with that and that is a stressful thing. Um And I guess my other source of stress would be like social stuff. Um, like I said, I'm not, like I said before, I'm not really the most social person, but when I do have social um situations I tend to ruminate on, ruminate on them afterward or I ruminate on how to answer messages and yeah, I just ruminate way too much about that kind of thing. So that's also a source of stress. Um, and then the other source of stress kind of related to that is I worry about like my loved ones, um, like family, friends, pets. Um, because most of my family members are also have some, um, illnesses or conditions or disabilities they work with and, um, are also struggling with money and just having a lot of struggles in general. Um, arguably a lot worse than me. Some of them. Um, so I worry about them and then I, you know, I worry about my pets getting hurt and everything too because I've had some bad experiences with that in the past. And, um, so, yeah, just all those things that, um, you know, a lot of them are kind of largely out of my control, but it's hard not to worry about them to some extent. Um, so I guess those are my main sources of worries. I'm not counting like, um, mental health stuff, although I've been actually pretty good with that for the last few years. I used to have O CD but it's more or less in remission. Um, so I don't worry about that too much nowadays.

Generally speaking I do worry about and a lot of that comes down to like my future, uh, to moving out to finding out where I want to move because I know I'll tell you right now, I don't want to stay where I am forever. And that's just, I mean, any gen Z you talk to, they probably say that about where they live. Um, I'm really just, I'm interested in, in moving from this kind of like small town, suburban area to a city. Uh, and it's just, it's worrying, thinking about the planning for that and thinking about getting a job and all that and a lot of the stress is that's like current involves a lot of college work, like, uh, getting assignments done. Um, I get worried about losing free time. I really do value my free time and my ability to just like, relax and watch a movie or play a game. And I, I worry about that, you know, fading away, um, kind of as I grow older and it certainly has and will continue to, I just want to find a good work life balance, which is the main thing that stresses me out really. That's like the overarching theme I feel like, uh, but I guess there's also, I mean, there's a lot of just different worries about, um, my anxiety or, or, or depression getting in the way of things. I, I worry about, um, you know, I don't wanna like fail a class but I worry about that. Um, and it's not likely, but I still worry about that anyways. Um, you know, just general stuff like that. I, I worry about, you know, not, not really finding anyone, uh, to settle down with but I mean, that's, that's really something that's kind of in the back of my head. Uh, most of the time because so much of the focus now is on getting work done and now I'm trying to, like, finish this month out and really just, uh, have a good summer after that. So, um, those are some of the things I worry about. I mean, I worry about my car breaking down. That wouldn't be fun, uh, because you need a car to live around here, which sucks.

Um at least for the better, it might make it harder to get out the situation or to solve a problem or whatever worry you might have because you're so busy dreading it and experiencing negative emotions. So I don't worry about too many things. Um Obviously, as a single parent, I would most likely always worry or think about finances and um budgeting. So that's what I'm working on now. And I think that's my main concern because with inflation going up, I find myself always um frequently having to rebut to add um maybe increase the expense of my grocery budget that I gave myself that week, even though I might be buying less things or the same amount of things, but I'm paying more. Um, like I said in the previous one of the previous questions I moved um mid school year. So both of my daughters are still allowed to attend that school, but the school is about 30 minutes away one way. So I'm also looking at gas and I worry about that as well because gas prices have skyrocketed, um, especially over the years like a roller coaster, but it never went down, it just dropped a little bit, then go right back up. So those are the two main things I worry about. Um And as a solution I also worry about or think about I should say, but concerned about maybe adding another source of income, another stream of income just to take care of that.

I hope I can depend on social security. But um a few years ago, my father died and he had come to our community to live near um me and just watching that process, uh I began to understand how expensive it can be uh at the end of life um as, as care needs go up um that well, care might be there that it's, that it's extraordinarily expensive and it can drain uh a person's resources um very quickly. Um uh And, and then so in my father's case, things worked out in the end, you know, he had, he had minimal resources but they, he had good health insurance and he, he was covered. Um and, and we had a care place, this was during COVID. So it was all mixed up um complicated. Um But it just kind of put that on my radar, um, of, of how hard it can be to find assistance for elderly or disabled, um, with health care needs and even when one finds it, how expensive that can be. Um, uh, other things I worry about, uh, are being able to, um, wanting to stay, uh, here in my home in my state. Uh, for the long term. I see how the landscape is changing politically. Um, uh, Iowa is becoming much more unfriendly, um, and conservative and, uh, honestly my adult Children, we have four adult Children will never move back here.

I've got a pretty severe, pretty severe anxiety. Um I have a lot of problems with executive dysfunction. So like a lot of people who have untreated problems in that area, I've weaponized anxiety and guilt to get myself to actually do things which is not healthy. It ends up with rampant anxiety and it's a very thin line between enough anxiety that you're able to get up and do a thing and too much anxiety and now you're having an anxiety attack. Yeah. So and I also have a lot of um oh, what is it? It's perceived um where you, where your brain tells you that people are unhappy with you or mad at you for like inane criticisms. Like I spent a lot of time like telling myself that they didn't mean anything by that. They didn't mean anything by that. They didn't mean anything by that. A person washing a dish while you were clearly getting ready to wash dishes just as you live with a lot of mentally ill people, they just didn't notice what was happening? Like, I've got a, I spend a lot of time rationalizing. I feel like it's safer to over rationalize than it is to let myself imagine things to worry about, but it doesn't stop the worrying. Um, so it's pathological for me. I don't really need a thing to worry about, but clearly money is, money is the big problem. Um, I was in a pretty unique situation where I had a very stable job. I didn't pay very much, but I thought it was going to last forever basically. And my costs are very low because I, um, I share a house where, uh, a lot of my rent is subsidized because, um, they're more physically disabled than I am and I basically do all of the housework for the entire house. And, uh, and it means that I'm, I'm actually contributing very little money wise. It's, it's all more of a, um, because one of my housemates has a, a very good secure job that pays very well and another is on disability. We're doing pretty well financially. Um, like it was, it was always best why I was also bringing in money and then we were doing actually very well. Uh, but that job evaporated in, uh, August of 2019 and it, uh, it dissolved in a very traumatic way, um, which I won't get into. It wasn't, it wasn't anyone's fault really, but it was a lot. And, um, it took me a while to find a job that, um, was anywhere near the same level of income that I felt like I could actually do for a good long while. And I got that job in February of 2020. And then in March, I don't know if you've heard, but there was a pandemic and I'm so, so job over. So I've just been doing a lot of freelance since then. So I'm terrible at the hustle. I'm terrible at hustling up work. I'm constantly worried about finding more work about making enough money because maybe I've made enough money for this week to be able to afford to feed my dog and cats. But what about next week? So the, the worry is constant and I know my friends would help me. But, you know, they're also strained because I'm bringing in less money than I was and, and prices keep going up. Inflation is fucking murdering us. So, so, yeah, a lot of times I feel like I would be a very normal and productive member of society. If I just happened to have been born independently wealthy, I wouldn't even need a ton of money just enough to survive month to month. But, um, but yeah, we've got, uh one of my housemates has terrible horrible lungs like her doctor said, don't get COVID, you will die. So, this whole pandemic, we've had to pick up whatever work we could at home. Luckily, uh their job is uh, remote.

I, I tend to look at things and not get overly stressed about them, but it, it's, it's gonna be like I'm repeating myself here because the thing that I worry about most is the declining safety in this city. I mean, I remember visiting this city. I mean, I used to live in a small town, oh, about 80 miles away and we would, you know, come up here to go shopping and stuff and it, and this town was a big city but it had a small town feel to it now it's getting more and more like maybe Seattle or Portland where you wonder what's going on. I, for, for instance, one thing I worry about is how I need to change my habits just because of the safety issue. Um, one of my favorite things to do used to be getting up like maybe three or four in the morning and taking a walk through Gonzaga University, walking down by the river and as it stands now, I really can't do that because you don't know what tweaker is gonna jump out of the woods. In fact, the last time that I actually did that was a couple of years ago and I had three guys on bikes. This was like about 3 30 in the morning, but they were shadowing me all the way to Gonzaga while I was wearing a black jacket and a black baseball cap. So they would ride by me and go up about a block and wait for me to pass them by. And the last time I passed him by before they decided they wouldn't follow me is that I heard one guy say is that guy security. So by wearing the black jacket and the black hat, they thought maybe I was security and maybe it was a bad idea to try to jump me and rob me. But basically, that's the only thing that I worry about is, is the decline of, of the feeling of safety in this town and it doesn't really worry me, but it definitely aggravates me and it makes me a little bit angry that I have to change my behaviors because of the way things are going.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Uh Maybe the biggest thing I've had to worry about lately is my yard was getting a little out of hand and every time I had a day off from work it would rain. So it was making it virtually impossible for me to be able to get my yard, uh taken care of and get it in order.

Oh, I'll just tell you a recent thing. I was, got so worried about. Um, I had just bought my first car like two years ago and it, it's, it's an oh seven, so it's very old but it only had like 75,000 miles on it and, and otherwise it was in really good condition. Um, I've replaced a few things on it and it was running like a charm until about a month ago. It started to overheat it idle like when I was at stoplights or, um, like in a drive-through or something. And I was a little, well, not just a little, I was really worried about it. Um, I was looking online trying to diagnose it myself so maybe I could fix it myself or I could just take it to the shop with its diagnosis. So I don't, didn't have to, you know, wait around for so long, but it could have been multiple, multiple things. It could have been this thing that thing. It could have been both things at once. Could have been nothing girl. It can't have been, nothing. Could have been none of those things. But the secret third thing. So I just took it into the shop. I sucked it up. I was like, I have a credit card. I could pay for it and it'll be fine, you know, blah, blah, blah. Uh I just blah, blah, blah, like my mom does anyway that ok. Anyway, so I took it into a shop and the evaluation to figure out what was wrong with it was free. So, you know, like kind of worried about nothing. So they evaluated what was wrong with it. It was three things, cooling system, thermostat and actually some electrical, some electrical wiring that they had to rewire and fix and now every problem that I have with it is gone and it's just fine.",1_car_know_like_didnt,stories_involving_cars

Um But I think still some of the most, uh most impactful answers are, uh things that I worry about are pretty simple. Just, you know, my overall safety, uh in general, obviously, I, I explained earlier that my neighborhood is, uh, you know, feels pretty safe, but that doesn't mean I still don't consider that or worry about it. Um My health uh without having health insurance. Unfortunately, it does mean that any sort of health issues that I may encounter are uh not as easily solved. Um Now, luckily I am in pretty good health overall and I haven't had any major health issues, but in the case that something does crop up, I, of course, you know, I have insurance. Um And then, you know, other a couple other things that I worry about are likely just paying the bills. You know, my employment situation hasn't been the absolute best. So sometimes I worry if I'll have enough money to pay the bills um in the long run, especially because it might be good for right now. But what if I, you know, was to lose my job, eat into my savings, that sort of thing.

Um, I hardly ever worry about myself but, um, I try not to worry but, you know, when you love people you just, you just worry about them, you know, and it's not a bad worry. It's just want everybody to be healthy, want everybody to have everything that they need. You know? It's just, it's not like a bad worry.

926,63d7f873276db97c2fb3b00c,SDOH,"All right. So the question is, describe some things you worry about. Um That's pretty simple for me. My mother has MS and I worry about the fact that she doesn't want to take her medication and this has been going on for years now and I can see a kind of a slow decline. She's taken medication in the past and it's helped, but she's decided at this point that she no longer wants to take her medication. So that kind of is what it is. And in my mind, I know that I'm gonna be required more and more to uh help with her and her situation, my brother has um autism and severe M R and if something happens to my mom, he's gonna be my responsibility. You know, I've been taking care of him since, uh I was about 16 years old, also helping my mom with giving her shots for MS and like I said, uh helping with my brother, haven't really actually had a chance to start living my own life yet. You know, when graduated high school, I had friends that were going out into the world and, you know, traveling and doing things that you should be doing at a young age. I didn't really have that opportunity. I stayed and I helped her take care of my family. My dad wasn't really in the picture at all. So, you know, when my mom chooses, or while my mom chooses not to take her medications, I wonder if she knows in her head anywhere that she's adding more responsibility, more stress to me. When I'd like, at some point, I'm 40 years old now. So I would like at some point to start living my own life, but that has not, uh, had an opportunity to happen yet. And I probably, I don't think it probably will. You know, I think my mom, she's more focused on her own life and happiness and what she wants and doesn't want. And I believe like as a parent, once you become a parent, it's no longer about you. It's about your kids and lifting them up. And I think it was just the luck of the draw. I, I got a, I was born into this family of people that are in great need. And so I try to just look at it from that perspective. Obviously, I'm strong enough to deal with it. Otherwise I would have broken long ago. There are a lot of other stressors. I have an uncle who, uh, is in great need. He lived with me for a little while. He had health issues and conditions. He, uh, had to go in for surgery. And obviously, and he was in and out of the hospital, he would call me in the middle of the night, you know, and need me to come down because I let him live in my basement for a while. And he would tell my nephew, I was trying to make it to the bathroom and I defecated on myself, I need your help and he's overweight. And so basically, I would start my day by taking care of my brother and then start taking care of my mom and then run my own side, hustles and businesses and then come home and my uncle would want me to come and sit and talk with him. Um I'm introverted. So this was a chore for me. I didn't necessarily want to do it, but because his family, I did it. And my uncle, he got worse and worse and there would be blood on the floor sometimes and he'd need me to drive him to the emergency room and he would urinate on himself and in the bed and eventually he needed a surgery and then he needed me to come sit with him and my brother and my mom still needed me. So the stress of all this did add up, which is one reason why therapy was important. And my uncle eventually moved out, which took some of the stress away. But there was still a great deal of stress with my mom and my brother and my uncle wanted me to come down to the place that he moved to, to continue talking and such. So stress is always there and I have a, well, I think that's enough. Thank you.",4_know_didnt_hospital_time,hospital

Um, so, um, yeah, I definitely do, um, you know, would like to, um, yes. Ok, like to not be so worried as much.

Uh, and I think I speak for a lot of current people in, in my age and, and in my kind of income bracket is losing that income and not having a safety net to fall back on. You know, I have, uh a lot of credit card, our debt due to COVID and losing our jobs. Uh, my and my partner's jobs at the same exact time, same exact day, uh from COVID and needing to use those credit cards to kind of pay off all the bills and everything that we needed. Uh, and still not recovering from that. It's really, uh, I am still dealing with, with all of that and the fallout of everything. And so the biggest thing that worries me is sure I have money now. But what about in a month? What about in six months? What about in a year? 10 years? Uh You know, it's really just, just that, uh I don't want for much. Uh, there's, there's definitely people that are, uh, not as lucky as I am to have the situation that I do. Uh, but that worries me not being able to pay bills or being hit with an unexpected expense that uh obviously I can't budget for because there is no extra money to put aside to budget for. Um And so that's the biggest thing that worries me is is uh income and just not being able to survive uh in the way that I like and being priced out of of my neighborhood that is already fairly cheap and not being able to uh continue to live in a place where I have lived for years.

So that's very stressful and it keeps me up a lot of mates. I barely scrape my ass is just doing odds and ends. Get by. Um, I been, that's a really stressful thing. And then I guess health health is another major concern. Health is deteriorating rapidly. Got many health problems piling up that I couldn't even afford if I had to pay for it myself. I don't have health insurance. So I, I don't even know how that works and I'm beginning to look into it. I have many problems right now, I guess.

And so I'm trying to keep that in the forefront of my mind, even though sometimes it's relatively kind of uh nervous to think about though honestly, I just kind of want to push that aside and keep what's really important in my mind to believe that I can always be successful as long as I work hard and honestly do exactly what I am passionate to do and like work at the highest possible level to provide it as much as possible, even on the days that whether rainy or even very busy, I feel it should always be prioritized at all costs because it's always just gonna help make it to that one step closer to actually achieving it.

And even before making that transition I packed up all of my stuff and moved halfway across the country by myself. So things I worry about are just like, uh, like the support system. Um, I mean, I keep in touch with my friends from these various places but it's not the same as physically having people present that if you wanted to go do something with them, you could go do it. I mean, my work friends are great but like, are we, like, hanging out outside of work? Like, no, but, you know, I know if I really needed something, if it came down to it, I could, like, depend on my work community. Um, would they be like my first go? To probably not.

Um I'm working a full time job and two part-time jobs trying to get solvent and it's been a really long slow process even working myself like a, like a workhorse.

Despite progress being made, racial discrimination still exists in many aspects of our lives, including housing, employment, education and interactions with the law enforcement. I worry about the safety and well-being of myself, my family and my community members, especially when it comes to encode with law enforcement. As we have seen too many cases of racial profiling and police brutality against black individuals, I also worry about the racial disparities that persist in our communities, such as disparities in access to quality of application, health care and economic opportunities. These disparities can limit our potential for success and hinder our ability to strive in our communities. Additionally, I worry about the future for black youth in our communities. I worry about the challenges they may face, including unequal opportunities, racial bias and systemic barriers that may limit their potential and hinder their success. Despite these concerns, I remain hopeful and committed to advocating for positive change. I believe that the raising awareness, speaking out against injustice and working through our systemic change we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations.

You know, I don't, I try to sign up for lots of different jobs that I think I could do, like working at, as a theater attendant, um, a cashier at a Walmart or a stalker at Walmart. And that's the kind of thing that I think that I could do because those are things that don't involve me to have face to face, uh, you know, the contact, a lot of it because that's the thing that I am not good at because where I have autism.

Now, I don't know if a lot of the researchers out there that pose these tests are aware about the worker side of things, but we're actually kind of worried about the future of mechanical Turk in particular because the website has been facing a dramatic decrease in the amount of work that is available on the website lately.

That's my goal and I usually do end up making that which is kind of great. It's a great income to help me get by now. Like I said, I live in a rural area so my bills are dirt cheap out here. The only things that I really have to pay for are the electric water, internet and some food and stuff like that. You know, and I can do that on a fairly low amount of money if I just keep things simple, live a simple life and only eat two meals a day, that kind of thing.

Uh We do have a lot of bills and a lot of debt that we are working to pay off. And I'm always worried that we will not be able to pay everything off or that we will credit more debt. I look for different ways and I think a lot of people nowadays look for different side incomes or side hustles because the economy is not too great and, uh, people's salaries or wages are not enough to cover a lot of bills such as mortgages and utility bills than what it used to be like.

Hopefully it doesn't. But eventually, obviously, we all die and our bodies will deteriorate. So I guess the worry is when my body, my mental and physical capac faculties begin to break down on me is a thing I'm concerned about just because I don't want it to happen prematurely. Another thing that I'm worried about is losing people or my pets that are close to me, loved ones, members of my family, close friends, things of that nature.

And I wouldn't even necessarily say that I'm worried about money in the future. But I am very, very focused on building a strong financial, financially independent life for myself for about 10, 20 years down the road. So I'm very focused on financial independence. I invest and save a lot of my money. About 20 to 30 35% of my income for that reason because I want to be in a situation where I never have to worry about money again.

Are they learning what they should be or they have to create, you know, reaching the right milestones that the other kids are things like that are all things you wear on a daily basis. And then you got on top of that just worrying about their health and safety and wanting them to grow up to be strong and vibrant beings. Um Something that's always there. I also worry a lot about my family went down to one income um recently voluntarily. But um we want, you know, my wife wanted to stay home with our Children. And so making sure we have enough funds to pay for everything we need to pay the mortgage each month and keep things as they need to be is it's very important and um definitely a stressful thing.

But um I've gone back to the pediatrician and, and um, talk to her about it because I was talking to talk to her about uh the situation with my older son, uh that I wanted to possibly hold him back a year. He missed kindergarten while we were in Oaxaca and COVID was going on and there was, and that was, wasn't enough, I think for him when we came here. Um I said that he missed kindergarten and actually we were in, we were in, we went to stay with my mom to sort of move back to the States. Move. Yeah. Or not. Move back for them. Move to the States, moved back for me. But she wasn't dealing with my younger son and kicked us out. But before she kicked us out and we went back to Oaxaca. Um, this, the school, the public school right down the street from her condo said that since my older son at the time, he hadn't gone to Kinder, he should have been in Kinder. So I need long story short short. My um older son missed out on Kinder. We came here in November, so he missed out on a bit of the school year, the year we came here. So first grade, maybe he didn't get enough and now he's in second grade and he has failed everything, each report card except for pe and art. When I worked with him over the weekend is a bit. He can, he's not bad at math. He's beginning to learn his sight words and to read a bit, but he has some problems. I don't know if it's short or long term memory what it is. Anyhow, after talking to the pediatrician, he's gonna go to this. A psychiatrist. Actually, my other son who was diagnosed by the school psychologist is gonna, oh, wait psychiatrist, the pediatrician gave me referrals for the psychiatrist for both of them. Even though, uh, I now know with my younger son that he is on the spectrum and the school is gonna put him in special education next school year um, I, I don't know if worry is a word but I think about a lot but my older son and both of them actually, when they finish high school, when my older son be someone who is able to work, I remember in California, um, I think these were special people. I sometimes just end up sitting near to on the bus. They worked at factories, our warehouses. So there was like, there was work for them. I wonder here if he's able to, if he is not disabled, if there's that kind of work for him in the future. My younger son should not work. He is barely beginning to speak at five years old. I'm not worried about these things. Actually, health care has been pretty good for, I don't, I don't know what it's like if you have paid health care, but for Medicaid it's been all right, especially with the access to care Medicaid rights. So I can't really say it's a worry but thinking about their futures concerns me. But it seems like so far after the art first art meeting and now getting appointments with a local psychiatrist for them both that we're gonna get on the right path in terms of mental health services for them.",3_know_like_friend_didnt,personal_dramatic_story

I mean, it's not that we're just in horrible health. My husband actually is in really good health, I think for his age because he exercises and he rides bicycles and things like that. But, um, I can just tell, you know, it takes a lot longer to get over things. I've hurt my knee and I can't seem to get that right. And my husband, even though he never used to get sick or get colds or anything like that, he seems to do that a lot more recently. So I think the biggest thing I worry about is our health as we get older. Um, I do worry about money, although we're pretty lucky that, um, we do pretty well. Um, our expenses are not too great and we've managed to be somewhat smart about money. Although recently my husband has done some things that has caused some stress. Um, for some reason he decided he wanted to get a motorcycle. I think it's one of those, well, I would say midlife crisis, but he's almost 60. So it's almost a late life crisis. But he decided he wanted one and he ran out and got a motorcycle and then he took the motorcycle class and he decided it wasn't for him. So now we're trying to sell that and then he decided he wanted a can. So, anyway, I guess my point here is he's wasting a lot of our money and savings that I depend on if we have any emergencies and keeps saying, oh, I can build that back up and reminding me that we do have a retirement fund and all that. But it just, it, it really, um, it stresses me out because I hate to knock him down on his dreams. You know, it's like if this is the thing that really makes you happy, go ahead and do it. But on the other hand, it just, it isn't practical. I do feel like that. It's, it's wasting money honestly. And, um, it, that just, it really does kind of stress me out that he has decided he wants to go with this course in life.

Um, and I, I'm stuck because, uh, my mother is going through cancer treatments and, um, you know, what money we have is basically being funneled to that. And, um, it's, it's hard because I worry that I'm gonna be stuck here, um, forever basically.

Uh, I think that the county as a whole would be a, a world's better. Uh, we'd see a drop in all this, this petty crime. Um, we see less, less people that, that have to live in a tent, you know.

I'm worried that eventually we won't be able to afford to live here because if they, and the average is maybe they increase it by $100 that can only go so far before we won't be able to afford to pay it. And I think there are many people in that situation. Um I also worry about, I mean, my, my husband in his job, he works in health care and he, he was working two jobs and he lost one of them during the pandemic. So now we're only depending on his one job and he's paying most of the bills. So I am, I'm not sure about the status of health care in this state and just the way that they all the mandates, they were trying to force some people and how they would force you to do this or else you can't have your job and just made everything impossible to even, to even work. I mean, I don't think they even cared if you were a good employee. You know, if you if you wouldn't comply, they were more interested in firing people than even giving them a chance or even, you know, wanting to give them an exemption. I'm just not sure what the, what the future is in health care in the state. It's kind of been ruined by what they've done during the pandemic. Um, I also worry about the cost of food and how prices are going up and I'm just hoping that we'll still be able to afford to buy things. I mean, I'm assuming that there will be things we might not be able to afford anymore because of the way the prices have gone up. We, we also might have to buy cheaper versions of things or not buy as much as we like. So just the, the economy in general I'm concerned about because it does look like it's, you know, not getting better and it probably won't. So I'm wondering what that will mean for the future and what will happen if the whole thing just crashes and what that'll mean for the monetary system here because they want to bring in the digital currency. It just makes it look like there will be a lot less freedom and then there will probably be chaos. So I'm just trying to be as prepared as I can, but I'm, I'm concerned, you know, because of my family and I, and all of us, I just want to keep them safe and, you know, have enough resources for all of us to be able to be ok and then maybe, you know, help others if they need it. So it, it's stressful and difficult to see, to see what's been happening. So that is, those are things that worry isn't a good habit and I try not to worry.

I had to get on waiting lists when I just became pregnant. Um, and it was still very, very hard. It's very expensive.

It's a matter of making sure that the right amount of money comes out of the accounts at the right time and that we're able to access the bills to get them paid.

I worry about the hummingbirds that I put hummingbird nectar out for because they haven't come back yet after it got cold. So I worry about that. Basically just worried about everything, worry about getting taxes done, worried about having work to do, worry about getting food sometimes because the grocery store just doesn't seem to have things that we're looking for half the time. So that's a constant strain. It's just trying to keep supplies in the house. Not that we can't get anything, but it's just really frustrating and worrisome when you're getting ready to go to the grocery store and you just don't know what they're gonna have and if you have to adjust or pay more than you expected to because prices go up.

I maintain my innocence of the charges against me. And that worries me, my, my, the fear of the future and my freedom and just me being able to live my life without that burden being on me. But also just the expectations of society and the opinions of those around me regarding that in a more broad sense. I was born in 98. So I'm a part of a generation that has not known a world without stress for lack of better phrasing. It's, there's always been something going on and there's always some sort of sociopolitical economic turmoil that just makes it hard to find peace. You go from 9 11 to 2008 recession to current recession now COVID war in the Middle East um chaos in the presidency and it just feels like there's no solid heading for the future and there's no solid foundation for the present um college degrees don't hold the weight that they once did. So me going to college kind of feels worthless considering that my current profession I could have easily done without. And yes, the experiences and the opportunities and my achievements are important, but they weren't worth the cost and, and, and to extend that idea further, I don't feel like it's easy to find a career if there are many careers left these days. So there's no longevity. It's, we're living for the moment because that's all we can do. And even that's not easy. It's, I have no prospects of feeling like I can get a house and find a wife and have Children and uh have a nice career and retire.

Is there enough hours in the week to do what I need to do to make enough money to live the life that I, I can to survive to do it again next week. And like I work a job where they're flexible and that you can pick up shifts but nothing's guaranteed. So hours could easily fluctuate where you weren't expecting that fluctuation. So then you have to budget extra and it's just, it's easier to almost list the things that I don't have to worry about than I would listing what I do just because I live in a constant environment of stress and worry and anxiousness just because it's impossible to find peace even for a moment where there's nothing I would have to worry about.

And the prices of everything has gone up so painfully in the last few years that it's becoming a serious problem. Uh, even a few years ago, which was the last time, I think, the year before the pandemic. So 2018 was the last time I had a major change in income, and it did go down significantly that year. Um, but I was still making it work, kind of just barely. But I was doing it, um, and I had plans that were going to lead to an increase in income. And then the pandemic hit, and I couldn't follow through on those specific plans. Um, and I'm still working on it, but everything's been so much slower. And in that time period, um, the way costs went up, Um, And then during the pandemic, uh, like, for instance, I don't drive, So I have to walk everywhere and with the stores being out of a lot of supplies during those that first six months of the pandemic or whatnot. Um, lots of times, they were out of what I needed. Like, for instance, toilet paper. Um, and I couldn't get to another store to buy some, so I had to buy it online. And that was super expensive and things like that. Um and then with the inflation in the last year or so, um, that's been real painful. And then because of all that other things, my rent went up. And my landlord had originally said that she wasn't going to raise the rent, But then, with the inflation being like it was, all of a sudden it not only went up but went up a lot. And so at this point, I am like, just barely paying the bills, like seriously dimes and nickels and back to ramen eating. So that's my major worry these days, Um, and then just my other worries are I don't know if it's middle age or whatnot. I assume so, because all of a sudden it seems like the world is falling apart, and I'm pretty sure back when I was a kid, people who were in their late forties and early fifties and whatnot were saying the same thing about back then. So I'm guessing it's just my imagination. But it doesn't feel like my imagination, especially things like climate change and partisan politics.

Most of it really is a financial and not only the financial like day to day, but the financial future. And also the fact that I'm so financially restrained that I can't do the enrichment things I wanna do with my life.

Um So that can be a little bit difficult and definitely anxiety inducing sometimes. But that being said, my bank is relatively well off, well structured and well diversified. Um The other things I worry about obviously with rising inflation just um the decrease the I guess, yeah, decreasing quality of life as in my pay at work necessarily, it definitely hasn't increased with the rate of inflation. Um So that being said I can just afford to do less even though doesn't feel like it should be that way. So that's definitely one of my anxieties is that our worries, it's just losing general quality of life. And then um yeah, so it sounds like most of my stuff is finance related. My relationship is pretty secure. I enjoy the town I live in, but I'd like to be able to get a second house. Um, so that we have another place to live in and kind of move on from this area with that being said and kind of going back and forth back to what I said before with the rise in interest rates and, you know, wages not keeping up with inflation. Um, it kind of seems like that idea of getting a second house keeps getting pushed off. Um, and then also me and my fiance are getting ready to finally get married next year. We're engaged currently, um, at the prices of weddings wasn't substantially higher than what I was thinking. But I just think the price of getting married and doing the whole show is substantial.

Um, so I really can't walk anymore. Um I have a very bad back.

Um, my back is causing such severe sciatic problems and my neck. I have a degenerative or dislocated disc. My back is actually shrinking. I can't walk very far and I don't want to be in an apartment forever. Um And I wanna be able to walk again, but I have a very bad spine. Um, you know, pain in my right, right arm, left leg last year I also tore my AC L which is completely useless in my MC L in my right knee and the left side's got the sciatic in my right arm also.

Plus I have to have general surgery to have something that's in my head removed. It's gotten into a large bump and I'm just worried about it getting infected. That was when I fell in February as well. Um So my medical and psychiatric issues are what I mostly worry about besides making stupid errors.

So that was kind of embarrassing.

But uh so, I mean, one could say it was worrying about finances and money, but it's, you know, that's just turning it into things like the light bill, turning it into things like. And then um as I mentioned earlier, you know, snap or food stamps, they help out a lot eliminating food budget, um the AC P program and um basically the American Connectivity program and the free cell phone service. That's a huge one eliminating your phone bill.

And there's a lot of times where, um, I've had to severely budget my grocery shopping to like $20 a week. Maybe I have a savings account thankfully because of, um, past privileges that I've had to be able to, like, build up a savings account.

Um, I'm paying for my dorm this first semester and my meal plan and everything, everything included, paying it for it myself. And then about fiveish months I'll be moving out officially for the very first time paying my own rent, paying my own bills and stuff like that. I don't have to worry about a car since the parking situation is dreadful. Here. My, I have to have money to be able to comfortably afford all of that. It's not even a luxury. It's just basic necessities, but something you always have in the back of your mind. Right. If all the money stopped coming in and how long would I able to fend for myself? Um, kind of related to money as my major. My major is computer information systems, half, computers, half business. And, uh, both fields are thriving. They're profitable. They make a lot of money. Um, and by getting the best of both worlds, I hope to be able to put myself in a position where a job without degree itself makes good money. And then eventually I might be able to start a business of my own and um proper, ensure that money isn't a problem for me. That's something later on in the road. Um Money also relates to how long I'm in college itself since I might have the opportunity to graduate early and graduating early would mean paying less for school. Because realistically for your career, you could finish in two years, you just put your head on and grind through it. The college is an experience that you only get once in life. And I don't, I don't want to rush through it. But if it helps my financial situation, I might just have to. That's the other thing I didn't, money is a big deal, but money only solves money problems and I don't want to have regrets further on about great. My financial situation is good. Life is great. I wouldn't change it for anything but I wouldn't have mind having this life being in a situation. Yeah, three years further down the line where I could have made more memories and met people.

Um, you always hear those stories about people finding their wives, their best man, uh, best friends in college and that just hasn't happened to me because I spend most of my time in my dorm room and it's just something that I have to keep thinking about the small stuff like grades and such. But I can, I'm an over thinker, like I overthink a lot and I'm also a perfectionist so it's not a very good combination. It's not in the world. The situation could always be better.

My, uh, I grew up in a rural family, a farming family and my father was the type that pretty easily let things roll off his back. My mother was the absolute opposite. She worried about everything. And I remember her and dad talking so many times and dad just pleading with her basically to, to stop worrying and she would wear herself sick literally. And, uh, my dad wasn't the type to worry. He was the type to examine things that happened to try to figure out if there was a lesson he needed to learn if there was something he could do better. But when he thought he had spent enough time on it to learn the lessons from it that he could and should, he would let it go. And I have absolutely tried to emulate that in my life because even as a kid growing up, I would look at the two of them and, you know, being a farmer, there's so much to worry about, you know, is there enough rain? Is there too much rain? Is it too hot? Is it hot enough. It's, you know, the crops are gonna grow. Is there gonna be a blight? What's the, uh, price gonna be when you sell the, the, the cattle or the grain? So many things you can't control so many things you have to hope will work out. And my mom would just always worry here even when things were going great, she just wear herself sick. So I don't do that. Sorry to spend so much time talking about what I don't worry about some of the things I do worry about. I've got two grand grandsons, grandchildren. And, um, since I've been born, I worry more about the future than I ever have. Climate change bothers me a lot and I, I don't worry about climate change. And within my lifetime, I'm 57 years old and I, I'll probably be dead and gone before in central Kentucky, climate change begins to make a huge impact. And that's kind of the reason that I guess I've not taken it more serious in my lifetime. I just figured it was something that, you know, generations down the road would have to deal with and worry about and it wasn't gonna affect me that much. But, uh, with my grandchildren, I don't know why I didn't want my daughter to love her to death. Didn't worry about it that much with her, but I absolutely do with my grandchildren. Um, I, I, with my grandchildren, I worry about the world that they're gonna inhabit, not just climate change but, uh, everything, you know, uh, what is life gonna be like in 50 60 years from now? And, uh, what's society gonna be like and what's the workforce gonna be like all that? So, yeah, worry more about those. But once again I try to, uh, I, I never worry about things like my mom did.

But we had to use our entire income tax return, which we were hoping to use in order to get ahead on bills. And we're constantly living from paycheck to paycheck, and we never have money to actually have fun and relax. I guess so. All of us are always kind of stressed. At least the adults in the house are, and it makes it very difficult for our quality of living living. Um, for obvious reasons, Whenever you're worried about rent or constantly getting your water or your electricity shut off, you're just constantly in survival mode. And that, along with inflation, has been really difficult for us as well, because we do receive food stamps and there's always that two week period where we struggle to find food or money to get more food. Um, it's again. Just a highly stressful situation, constantly living and survival mode. Um, on top of my personal stress that I have, You know, it's like we have household stress as well. Um, but my personal stress would be the inability to look for and find, uh, employment that I can actually do as being disabled and constantly feeling like I could be doing more. And I can't do anything at all. Really. Um, also just general mental health things and stress and not having very many friends in the city. It just kind of weighs on you over time.

Are they actually feeling as though their needs are met and that they're happy and things like that?

And you have since you were a kid yourself, and it just doesn't seem fair sometimes, but the world isn't fair, and you come to accept that I have a lot of people have, but, um, yeah, you still always see people living to the max and having fun and being stress free, it seems, or wishing that their stresses were things that you have to stress about. And instead you're worried about life or death situations. Can you go to the dentist to get the root canal you've been needing for so long?

Uh So I got laid off a couple of months for a couple of months also after that, um went through it, they went through a restructuring after I accepted that position and I was without a job for two months. So that did not help the situation. So I am um financially really, really struggling and it's a huge, huge amount of stress on me, uh, constantly, um, trying to do side jobs to try to get caught up, but I don't think I'm ever going to get caught up.

I tend to worry about everyone around me and making sure that they are comfortable and safe and you know, having the the best times they can. But I think for the most part, my worries would be just as generalized as the vast majority of Americans. When it comes to our political climate and our civil climate, things aren't going too great. So that's a consistent little little thing yelling in my ear there. But to take it away from a global level, just the the average, making sure it ends me, making sure I'm taking care of myself and trying to practice self-respect, which then in turn leads to me making sure my bills are paid and making sure my house is clean and all of that fun stuff.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Our our rent is cheap for the area. We pay about $800 a month in rent for a house. Um But then our electric is $100 a month. Our heat is about 20 to $50 a month. There's um wifi, there's cell service, the bills just keep adding up. You've got car insurance, gas, food and people can't afford this on a minimum wage salary. Uh You'd make like $100 a month.

Um, it just, you know, was a little bit frustrating but now I'm at a point where, I don't know when I'm gonna get my next, my next prescription filled and it seems like it's only gonna get worse since, like, apparently the FDA didn't approve more pre prescriptions to be filled.

1103,63f784d75e0dba3bedbb366b,SDOH,"So some things that I worry about. Um, I'm not a warrior for one. Let this be clear. Um I'm very good about not worrying about things because I don't feel like worrying like nine times out of 10, it's not necessary, but, you know, there are some words that I have like, um, I was worried about. Well, I think I sometimes worry for other people more so than I do myself. Like I worried about how my mother was going to be able to afford her bills. Um, or not even, it's not about her affording bills. It's just about making a living that is sustainable for her and her lifestyle, like, and she's really like flu fumbling and floundering around, I think, trying to find like just any old job. Um, and it's like hard to see that and to witness that for me because I don't give a virus unless people ask for it. Um I don't tell people how to live their life unless people ask for it. Um And so I just kind of like, have to watch her go through those things and to make certain decisions that I wouldn't make. Um, and it's not even about that I would make but it's like that I wouldn't make if, if I was in her body because, um, I feel like some people are, some people don't know how to make decisions that work for them in their bodies. Right. Um, and some people don't, they, like, try to make things like decisions based off what they think they want rather than what they, what's probably best for them in that sense. I don't know how to describe it. Um But that's, you know, that's one thing that I worry about. Um, I also worried about, well, I haven't really worried about my move but I was worried about like being self-destructive, um, because I got a new job opportunity and I have to relocate and I have to move. I'm very far away pretty soon and I was kind of worried about, I think not being good enough, not like, not in that sense, but mostly like, like it would like, be like snatched away from me. That's a worry that I have. And, you know, I was, I've been doing a lot of meditating and reading, you know, good, positive self help books. So I don't, you know, end up self sabotaging myself with my own thoughts. And, um, so that was something that I actually have been worried about just making sure that I'm not be my own worst enemy. Um Another thing I worried about is like, I just feel like, I've had a lot of like, distance from a lot of my close people in my life, like friends or people I would consider on that friend circle level. And I worried about like leaving like my city, my home, like where I'm living now, like just like leaving without a big send off or without anyone really knowing or caring.

I'll see like one little bump or feel like a pain somewhere and then like, you know, oh, it's blood clot. I don't know, like just I'm in constant panic. Um, I can read symptoms online and then I'll start experiencing those symptoms. Um, so that's a pretty big worry. Um, I also have a bug phobia.

Um, this is very small wooded type community area, so it's, bugs are pretty bad. Um, I would prefer to move out of this area, but due to my mental health problems, I've kind of just been stuck here.

Um, so in like a situation that something happened to him, you know, I'm not already set up with that and it can take years, you know, to get on that.

Um, I worry that I'll never be able to find the right kind of help for my mental health issues and my physical health issues or worry about losing my teeth. Um, my teeth genetics pretty bad and constantly going to the dentist and then of course, the dentist appointments make me, you know, to use the numbing needles and you have to get teeth removed and get feelings and just all this and it's, I'm a mess most of the time.

Um I don't know how people do it where they have like a job that they have to drive to and study full time. So I have a job that's online and work is very inconsistent. Some weeks I can crank out a bunch of hours other weeks I can't. Um, but my bills are consistent.

Oh, if I don't find a way to get money right now I'm not gonna be able to pay, you know, my bills. But, um, I do wish my employment was more stable and I'm always looking for other ways to make money, I guess, like this, like this, this study. So, um, yeah, my main worry would be financial. Um, another worry, I guess would be academic as I not really academic, more, um, career oriented. Um, as I said, I'm about to graduate, um, with a degree in psychology, which is not, it's not useless, but it'll definitely take me some time to find a job that is relevant to what I studied and also pays reasonably well. Um, because soon enough I will have to find my own place. And, um, yeah, I mean, I guess in that for that example, it's just the unpredictability of the job market right now. That worries me. Um, because I'm about to enter it in a professional capacity, I guess since right now I'm doing like entry level positions. That's all I've ever had. Um, so, yeah, another thing that worries me. So I run a small business making, um, vinyl decals and stickers and creating, well, basically just graphic design. Um, that is actually turning into most of my income right now. But I stress about it because it's a lot of work and it's a lot of work that doesn't see immediate results and the way that I think kind of hinders my ability to run a business because I'm always looking for immediate results and I know that it's a fault of mine and I stress about it because I have to be able to set that aside and work on something and work on something even though I'm not gonna get immediate results. So, yeah, that stresses me out. Um, and that's also another kind of unpredicted, unpredictable source of income even though it is growing to where I'm comfortable. Um, that also means more work since I am getting paid specifically by my output. Um, like I make, I make a, a truck sign, I get paid, I make a sticker. I get paid.

So I'm working on that and with my son just spending time with him, uh He's under a year old. So any time I can grab him, take advantage of that so the wife can get some rest. Then another thing is if I'm a good role model to my bible study group of high schoolers, we meet on a week, weekly basis and I lead lessons and I just want to be a positive influence in their life. Uh The other thing is uh balancing friends, family and ministry. Uh It's uh it's quite the juggle and uh just last week I decided I would be giving up one of my ministries with choir and then taking on something that we can do as a family. And that's focusing on young couples in our church, like hosting them in our house and just having them over for dinner and then just building those relationships. And another thing is uh projects that I need to tackle, but I'm not the most capable, I'm not quite the person for the job.

Um, you know, having to use a credit card to pay for groceries instead of having the available income to do that. Um, having to start making choices as far as what to spend money on what not to spend money on. Um, you know, feeling like I can't do as much for my kids or with my kids.

Um And then just with my parents aging, like just worrying about them and their well-being and um both kind of having their own personal health struggles and just wondering how they're really gonna fare as they get older as they get more vulnerable and recognizing that I don't really have like a strong caretaker interest, um, and wouldn't be good to step into that role.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

Um Will I have the energy to make food for dinner? Will I like sleep enough? Well, I have enough time to do the things I want to do. Um And there's other stuff like, uh will I ever be able to do more creative stuff? Will I ever have a whole day where I don't have some sort of depressive episode and feel really shitty?

Will I just leave them there until I just get so angry that I just have to like manically clean them? Um, which will probably be what happens.

They're, they're like contract works and, uh, you know, that that's not secure work. That's not, you know, that, that's not entirely something I could be proud of or, or anything like that. Um, and so I, I really worry on what will happen, uh, later on in my life. Uh, I'm doing a couple of things. I, I tried to start up my own business. I, I tried doing youtube and social media.

Um, I've tried, you know, I've, I've just tried so many different things in hopes that I, I get a feel and I'm like, oh, yeah, I like, I like doing this and, or, or see if something sticks or, you know, it's kind of like testing things out. So, um, but at this point I, I'm pretty much graduating and I'm trying to give it my all to computer science and getting a job, another job in I T, but it's not looking good. And so I would say that's probably my biggest worry is just job security, especially now since, um, there is a hi, um, there is a lowering demand of programmers. Um, as of right now. In fact, there are mass layoffs and, and a lot of tech companies and not only tech companies, you know, there, there's been mass layoffs in, in general, um for programmers, right? And so the job outlook is not looking good. And uh if, if I wasn't sure I, I was gonna get one before then I'm definitely not gonna get a job in I T now. And that's also why I started testing things, right. Um But yeah, I would say that's, that's probably my greatest worry is just job security. Um Some other things I worry about is, um my, my health.

So that, that's also kind of scary. Um So I really got to cut back on that but at this point it's kind of just something that's ingrained in me being me. Um, other things I worry about are just, um, parents. You know, they're growing older. I could tell by now that they're not gonna be able to keep up with work and they're gonna have to retire soon. And that's unfortunate and with my job outlook not looking so great. Um, and me being one of the main caretakers of them, uh, once they finally go into retirement, meaning they, you know, they might be screwed, especially since they're already living paycheck to paycheck. You know, they have no savings. They, they wasted it all high and well, not wasted. They, they used it to get me to college in hopes that I, you know, take care of them in the future.

She's always been just a really kind person and a rock, you know, whenever you need someone to talk to and you just really think fondly of that person, you know, and I'm trying to visit her at least every weekend and things like that.

It's like, definitely kind of stressful to figure it out. So. Yeah.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

I worry about myself getting older and I don't have a spouse and what's gonna happen to me when I get older? I just got over sickness and like, who's gonna take care of me when I'm older? And, uh, my parents are getting older. My brother's getting older, everyone's getting older. I worry about all our health. My cat's getting older. He's 13. Well, he's gonna be 13 in September. I worry about him. The vet said he's ok. But I don't know, he's looking thinner to me and like, oh, I live in the country and I would love to move to the suburbs, you know, some, at least some close to things and stores in the hospital. Not that I have to worry about that just yet. But who knows? You know, they had food poisoning and from that I had a U T I, so I was sick for like two weeks. It was crazy. Uh, and then I had to wait to get my prescription because my dad can't drive at night. I know he would still drive at night. But I don't want him to drive at night because I worry about him going through an accident. See, anxiety is not fun. You worry about everything. I worry about filling up a minute and a half of just talking. I'm almost there though. So see, like I said, I do service online so I'm trying to save up money so hopefully I can get a house for like how long is that gonna take? I'm like, should I get a regular job? But I haven't worked in so long because I had anxiety really bad. Oh my God. But yeah, I worry about a lot of things on the outside. I, I, some cool, calm, cool, collected on the inside. I am just a hive buzz.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism

I mean, everything work, my health, my boyfriend's health, my father's health, my mother's health, I'm not spending enough time with my, my nieces. I'm not spending enough time with my boyfriend's family. I'm isolating myself from others. My weight, my ability to make money if I quit my job, my job and plus my other jobs. Um, yeah, I'm always worrying about something, there's always something to worry about. Um, I'm worried about the health and safety money. My grandmother, um, everything, everything, there's everything to worry about all the time and worried about the state of the country. Divisions, mass shootings, the prevalence of guns, conservative values taking over. Um, worry about the kids I work with. It's ridiculous. Honestly, it's way too much worrying to be had, um, existential things, karma. Um, social justice.

1233,6127c5e5db9bf1a49993c300,SDOH,"A lot of things worry me. That's, um, something I'm working on with a therapist, uh, primarily on the future of this country. Uh, it's not looking good. Um, the inability, especially in such a college campus town, you see the emotionally charged left versus right. Well, here it's mostly just left versus everybody. But, uh, the whole political spectrum is really, uh changing and, uh, the majority of us out here are independent and, uh, we don't have a voice though because you either have to go left or right. And, uh, majority of us Americans are independent. I worry a lot about situation. I'm in living paycheck to paycheck. Um, I worry about my transportation. I need, need, need new tires. I worry about the future of the restaurant hospitality industry as automation is coming. Um, but like I said, I try not to worry and just, uh, keep on moving forward. Um, I worry about the state of academia, the, uh, inability of them to support others with other opinions, ability to have a normal conversation about issues and ideals that are a problem to the community or even larger. Um, it's either just so one sided one way or another and, uh, it's just a lot of civil unrest. Unfortunately, I don't know if it's the demographic of this area but, uh, like I said, I try not to worry about it. Try to avoid them. I also worry about the health of my, uh, father. He's getting older and I love him. So, you know, in general, I try not to be a worrisome person but you guys asked. So.",15_future_optimistic_worry_im,future_optimism_pessimism
