# Basic Cleaning {.tabset}
1. load & deidentify data 
  1a. Prolific status check -- merge & address data deletion
2. deduplication + duplicate summary
3. summarize consent, terms & NDA (where applicable) + additional participant "electives" (e.g., here "content_recruit")
4. attention checks & recording test
5. summarize qualtrics completion (retention/completion rates) 
5. codebook 
6. write cleaned csv + dictionary 

## load & de-identify Qualtrics data 
*notes: (1) this is pretty specific to prolific studies, can be adapted as needed [see calarts for example] (2)select line @ end will need to be adapted slightly based on any additional PII collected [see calarts]*

After excluding testing cases, 3014 observations are included in the dataset
```{r clean test & deidentify}
#survey <- read_sav("/Users/kristina/Downloads/Let's Talk About Well-Being_August 2, 2023_07.59.sav")
survey <- import(here("inputs", raw_file_name))

  dplyr::rename(userid = PROLIFIC_PID) %>% # standardize userIDs
  select(userid, everything()) %>% # move userID to the front
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., ""))) #convert empty cell into NAs

# add labels 
attr(survey_filtered$userid, "label") <- "User IDs that can be used for data merging"
```

## Prolific status check

Records from 2573 participants are included in the prolific dataset. Among them, 2 participants don't have matching data from the survey dataset, and both of them revoked their consent. 392 observations from 387 participants in the survey dataset don't have matching data in the prolific dataset. Their prolific_status will be marked as "TIMEOUT"
```{r prolific merge}
#prolific <- read.csv("/Users/kristina/Downloads/prolific_export_639e73b38884ae6555e593ca.csv")
prolific <- read.csv(here("inputs",prolific_user_file))

# tidy prolific dataset
prolific_tidy <- prolific %>%
  rename_all(~paste0(., "_prolific")) %>% # add suffix
  dplyr::rename(userid = Participant.id_prolific) %>% # standardize user IDs name
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.character),  # recode null data into NA 
                       ~  case_when(
                              . == "DATA_EXPIRED" ~ NA,
                              . == "Prefer not to say" ~ NA,
                              TRUE ~ .)))

# merge with survey data
survey_merged <- survey_filtered %>% left_join(prolific_tidy, by = "userid") %>%
  mutate(Status_prolific = replace_na(Status_prolific, "TIMEDOUT"))

# check participants from the prolific file that can't match in the survey data file

length(unique(survey_notmatch$userid))

# flag non-matched observations
prolific_notmatch_id <- unique(prolific_notmatch$userid)
survey_notmatch_id <- unique(survey_notmatch$userid)

survey_match_f <- survey_merged %>%
  mutate(flag_nomatch_prolific = case_when(userid %in% prolific_notmatch_id ~ TRUE,

attr(survey_match_f$flag_nomatch_survey, "label") <- "TRUE if the observation is included in the survey data file but not in the prolific file"
```

## Consent & Terms
68 participants (no duplicate IDs) revoked consent or did not complete consent upon entering the study. These participant IDs are removed, leaving 2878 total observations. 

70 participants returned the study in Prolific, effectively revoking consent. There are various reasons for a user to return their survey, which are detailed below where possible. Data coming from these users is removed from the dataset here.  
*notes for iteration: (1) will want to probably merge other data (moments etc) before this step so all data is removed/accounted for (2) can add details via excel import/merge of notes?*
```{r clean consent} 
# remove data from revoked consent
survey_cleaned = survey_match_f %>%
  filter(!Status_prolific == "RETURNED") %>% # remove returned surveys
  filter(Consent_confirm == 1) # only include data from confirmed consent

#summarize returned responses
data_remove <- survey_match_f %>%
  select(userid, Status_prolific, Submission.id_prolific) %>%
  unique() %>%
  filter(Status_prolific =="RETURNED") %>%
  group_by(userid, Status_prolific,Submission.id_prolific) %>%
  mutate(detials = "") 
data_remove<- data_remove[order(data_remove$userid),]

  mutate(percent_available = round(((APPROVED+TIMEDOUT)/nrow(survey_match_f)) * 100, 1))
```

## Summarize qualtrics: consent, terms agreement, NDA, attention checks, recording tests, etc {.tabset}

### deduplication & duplicates summary
There were 100 total duplicate reponses, from 49 unique participants, **thus in this study, data was collected from 2827 unique participants**. Duplication in survey data could have happened if the participant accessed and started the Qualtrics study multiple times. Here, we retain all duplicated data and flag each response, responses are also flagged based on completion. See below for details.

```{r flag duplication}
survey_dupe_f <- survey_cleaned %>%
  group_by(userid) %>%
  mutate(flag_dupe_survey = duplicated(userid) | rev(duplicated(rev(userid)))) %>% # flag rows with identical userid
  dplyr::mutate(
  max_progress = max(Progress),
  distinct_progress = n_distinct(Progress),
  total_rows = nrow(.)) %>%
  mutate(
    flag_most_complete_survey = case_when(
      # Unique userid cases
      flag_dupe_survey == F ~ "TRUE",
      
      # Duplicated userid but identical progress
      flag_dupe_survey == T & total_rows > 1 & distinct_progress == 1 ~ "SAME",
      
      # Duplicated userid with non-identical progress
      flag_dupe_survey == T & Progress == max_progress & distinct_progress > 1 ~ "TRUE",
      flag_dupe_survey == T & Progress != max_progress & distinct_progress > 1 ~ "FALSE",
      
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  ) %>%
  select(-max_progress, -distinct_progress, -total_rows) %>%
  ungroup()

attr(survey_dupe_f$flag_dupe_survey, "label") <- "TRUE: data from userid that have more than 1 occurrence; FALSE: data from unique userid"
attr(survey_dupe_f$flag_most_complete_survey, "label") <- "TRUE: data from unique userid or has the highest progress among duplicated responses; FALSE: duplicated responses that donâ€™t have the highest progress; SAME: duplicated response that share the same progress"

table(survey_dupe_f$flag_dupe_survey)
length(unique(survey_dupe_f[survey_dupe_f$flag_dupe_survey == TRUE,]$userid))
```


### Failed recording test
35 participants failed the recording test, 204 had missing data. 

The `flag_failed_recording_test` marks if the parcipants failed the recording test, retaining NA/missing. 
```{r flag failed testing}

survey_dupe_f %>%
  select(survey_name, userid, Recording_test) %>%
  unique() %>%
  gather(Recording_test, value, Recording_test) %>%
  filter(is.na(value)|value!=1) %>%
  group_by(Recording_test, survey_name, value) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n = n())

survey_record_f <- survey_dupe_f %>%
  mutate(flag_failed_recording_test = case_when(Recording_test == 0 ~ TRUE, 
                                                Recording_test == 1 ~ FALSE,
                                                TRUE ~ NA))

attr(survey_record_f$flag_failed_recording_test, "label") <- "TRUE if participants failed teh recording test. NAs were retained"

```


### Failed attention check
Here, there were 2 attention checks, correct responses for each are noted in the attention1_correct & attention2_correct columns, respectively. 

`flag_failed_attention` = FALSE if both attention checks passed
`flag_failed_attention` = FALSE if 1 attention check passed + 1 missing 
`flag_failed_attention` = TRUE if at least 1 attention checks failed
`flag_failed_attention` = NA if both attention checks are missing

`flag_failed_attention_n` = total number of attention checks failed (NA not counted as failure)

61 observations had 1 failed attention check question, 2 observations had 2 (failed both questions), 173 had at least 1 attention check missing data without an explicit failure (so either passed 1 or both NA)
```{r flag failed attention checks}

# add a flag for failed attention check question and a flag for the number of attention check
survey_attention_f <- survey_record_f %>%
  mutate(flag_failed_attention = case_when(
    Attention1 == attention1_correct & Attention2 == attention2_correct ~ FALSE, # FALSE if both attention check questions were correct 
    Attention1 != attention1_correct | Attention2 != attention2_correct ~ TRUE,  # TRUE if get at least 1 attention check question was wrong
    is.na(Attention1) & is.na(Attention2) ~ NA, # NA if both attention check questions are missing
    TRUE ~ FALSE # FALSE if there's one question correct and one quetion missing
  )) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(flag_failed_attention_n = case_when(
    flag_failed_attention == T & (is.na(Attention1) | is.na(Attention2)) ~ 1, # if there's a missing data, and an incorrect answer, mark 1
    TRUE ~ (Attention1 != attention1_correct) + (Attention2 != attention2_correct) # if no missing attention check question, add the number of failed question
  )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  as.data.frame()

table(survey_attention_f$flag_failed_attention_n, useNA = "ifany")

# add label
attr(survey_attention_f$flag_failed_attention, "label") <- "TRUE if at least 1 attention checks failed; FALSE if 1 attention check passed + 1 missing or failed both; NA if both attention checks are missing"
attr(survey_attention_f$flag_failed_attention_n, "label") <- "total number of attention checks failed (NA not counted as failure)"
```


### Content recruit/release 
1956 (~68%) of participants responded "yes" to the question *"Would you be interested in being contacted about a later Prolific study where you provide voice recordings for us to use in our companyâ€™s future projects?"* See below for details.
```{r screen consent recruit}
n_obs <- nrow(survey_attention_f)

survey_attention_f %>%
  select(survey_name, userid, content_recruit) %>%
  unique() %>%
  gather(content_recruit, value, content_recruit) %>%
  filter(value ==1) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent_recruited = round((n / n_obs) * 100, 1))

content_recruit <- survey_attention_f %>%
  select(survey_name, userid, content_recruit) %>%
  unique() %>%
  gather(content_recruit, value, content_recruit) %>%
  filter(value ==1) %>%
  group_by(content_recruit, survey_name) 
DT::datatable(content_recruit)
```

## Additional data screening {.tabset}

### Missing all survey data

129 observation didn't provide any survey item data
```{r flag no survey data}
# extract survey item variables
survey_var <- value_between(colnames(survey_cleaned), first_survey_var, last_survey_var)


survey_survey_f <- survey_attention_f %>%
  mutate(flag_no_survey = (rowSums(is.na(dplyr::select(., all_of(survey_var)))) == length(dplyr::select(., all_of(survey_var)))))

table(survey_survey_f$flag_no_survey, useNA = "ifany")

attr(survey_survey_f$flag_no_survey, "label") <- "TRUE if participants didn't provide any survey data; FALSE if at least 1 survey item was recorded"
```

### Data quality: repetitive responses in a sequence

We want to flag participants who provided identical responses in a long sequence. The highest percentage of identical sequence is 35%, which is within a reasonable range
```{r screen repetitive responses}
# calculate the number of survey item 
item_n <- ncol(select(survey_survey_f, all_of(survey_var)))

survey_screen <- survey_survey_f %>%
  mutate(max_identical = apply(select(., all_of(survey_var)), 1, function(x) {max(rle(x)$lengths)}), 
         max_identical_perc = round((max_identical/item_n)*100))

describe(survey_screen$max_identical_perc)

attr(survey_screen$max_identical, "label") <- "The number if identical survey responses in a seqeunce"
attr(survey_screen$max_identical_perc, "label") <- "The perceptage of identical survey responses in a seqeunce out of all survey items"
```


### Study duration

check the distribution of survey duration among those who completed the survey within 2 hours. The expected completion time was 45 minutes. 
```{r screen duration}
# subset completed observations
survey_complete <- survey_screen %>%
  filter(flag_most_complete_survey!="FALSE") %>% #filter dupes & no survey data
  mutate(Progress = ifelse(Progress == 100, "complete", "incomplete")) %>%
  filter(Progress == "complete") %>%
  mutate(duration = Duration__in_seconds_/60) # transform survey durection into minutes

# check overall duration
describe(survey_complete$duration)

# check duration distribution within 2 hours
hist(survey_complete[survey_complete$duration < 120,]$duration)

```

To further examine those responses with a completion time of less than 10 minutes, we pair these data with other data screening results. Considering all screening, the data quality here looks fine. Therefore, no flag is necessary based on survey duration. 
```{r screen duration cont}
survey_complete %>%
  filter(duration < 10) %>%
  select(flag_no_survey, duration, flag_failed_recording_test, flag_failed_attention_n, max_identical_perc)
```

## Summarize data screening results

Based on all data screening efforts, 2692 observations are recommended to include in the analysis. Criteria include:
- at least some survey data
- did not failed both attention check questions 
- is the most completed survey if there were duplicates. 

These column identified as "recommended for analyses" are flagged in the `flag_rec_include` column
```{r flag recommended obaservation}
  
# mark the observation
survey_tidy <- survey_screen %>%
  mutate(flag_rec_include = case_when(flag_most_complete_survey != FALSE & flag_no_survey == FALSE & flag_failed_attention_n != 2 ~ TRUE,
          TRUE ~ FALSE))

table(survey_tidy$flag_rec_include, useNA = "ifany")

# add labels
attr(survey_tidy$flag_rec_include, "label") <- "TRUE if WB team recommend to include this observation. Criteria include:- at least some survey data
- did not failed both attention check questions 
- is the most completed survey if there were duplicates. "
```

# exclude data based on manually checking prolific status

## select data that need to be manually checked on prolific

These are the observations in the survey data that are not included in the downloaded prolific dataset but provide at least some valid data. We have 233 observations from 232 participants that need to be checked on prolific
```{r}

## SWLS
A total score is calculated by adding up the scores for each item. The possible range of scores is 5-35, with a score of 20 representing a neutral point on the scale. Scores between 5-9 indicate the respondent is extremely dissatisfied with life, whereas scores between 31-35 indicate the respondent is extremely satisfied.
```{r}
# calculate life satisfaction sum score & recode categories
surveys_scored <- survey_demo_r %>%
  mutate(SWLS_tot = rowSums(select(., contains("SWLS_"))), # compute the sum score
         SWLS_tot_f = case_when(5 <= SWLS_tot & SWLS_tot <= 9 ~ "Extremely Dissatisfied",  # categorize the sum score

## PERMA
Positive affect is calculated as the average of PERMA positive emotions items 1,3,6
Negative affect is calculated as the average of PERMA positive emotions items 2,4,5
```{r}

## PWB
Q1, Q2, Q3, Q8, Q9, Q11, Q12, Q13, Q17, and Q18 should be reverse-scored.
**NOTE: response options were anchored incorrectly, reverse score opposite of what is noted (items 4,5,6,7,10,14,15,16 reversed)**
Reverse-scored items are worded in the opposite direction of what the scale is
measuring. The formula for reverse-scoring an item is:
((Number of scale points) + 1) - (Respondentâ€™s answer)

The Autonomy subscale items are Q15R,Q17,Q18. The Environmental Mastery subscale
items are Q4R, Q8, Q9. The Personal Growth subscale items are Q11, Q12, Q14R. The
Positive Relations with Others subscale items are Q6R, Q13, Q16R. The Purpose in Life subscale items are Q3, Q7R, Q10R. The Self-Acceptance subscale items are Q1, Q2, and Q5R. 

To calculate subscale scores for each participant, sum respondentsâ€™ answers to each subscaleâ€™s items. Higher scores mean higher levels of psychological well-being.
