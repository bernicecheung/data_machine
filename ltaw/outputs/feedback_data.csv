"5dc483cf74939e34e55c3619","This was nice. One thing to add -- I've recently discovered, while doing work here on Prolific, that conversations with an AI chatbot has been beneficial in thinking through issues. Much better, for me, than a person."

You can let me know through Prolific messaging if that was indeed the case and there is something I can do to fix it.  Thanks"

"5c6d5477e8833000015244ad","I just want to say that I'm very upset that I did all this recordings except for one I accidentally clicked yesterday uploaded it and clicked next before I actually had a chance to upload the audio recording so it didn't get uploaded and now I'm screwed out of the the bonus or the 10 dollars or whatever it is and I did all the work and all the recordings except for the one I forgot to upload and do you guys set the parameters so I couldn't go back a page and rerecord it once I had gone forward and it sucks and it pisses me off that the option wasn't there for me to go back to your record so I did all this work for nothing pretty much."

"5e4aa3729d301e000cf8ced9","90 seconds is way too long to answer those questions without more prompts! I was mad about it at first, then I just started to talk stupid because that‚Äôs what I do when I monologue. It‚Äôs not natural to talk AT someone for 90 seconds, and you don‚Äôt even know who you‚Äôre addressing"

"602084a1e5330d6c7ad1d17e","I recorded the first question, but didn't realize I had to accept it in the black box before accepting it with the Yes. My fault entirely. Yes, it was emotionally charged, but I needed to process the directions. Tried to find a back button to do it again. All the other recording pages had a back button but I couldn't seem to find one to get me clear back to the first question. My sincere apologies, and would be happy to do that first question again if it helps keep your data complete. What an amazing study. Thank you.."

When I got to the final recorded question I wasn't sure if I clicked accept on all the records, so I went back to the double check. However, it doesn't save your answer for these questions so I needed to recorded the answer to those questions again. Sorry about the double answers, but I wanted to make sure you got all the answers. Other than that, there were no problems. Thank you!"
