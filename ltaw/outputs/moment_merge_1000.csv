It's funny because when I started playing the game, I played it on basically hard and there was like a very hard difficulty. And I had a friend who told me that while playing on normal difficulty that they had like failed this boss fight like over and over and over and over again and on hard difficulty, I was able to get through that boss fight and like I think three attempts and I was really proud of myself and I was proud of myself in general of how I was doing in the game. So I was like you know, I'll try it, I'll try it on very hard, it can't be that much harder can it? But no it's it's not just very hard, it's like insane difficulty, it's extremely punishing. Where if you you have to like do things completely differently and if you make the slightest mistake then you take an absurd amount of damage and you will get one shot or two shot and it's it's really hard but it will make you very good at the game. And other games like it um there were bus fights where I don't think I've ever been so intensely focused on anything in my life and I was like doing these boss fights where like my heart was pounding and I was just like tightly gripping the controller and I was just there was nothing but me and like the movements in the game and dodging the right attacks and pairing the right attacks. I think the only other thing that came close to it was another game called seccuro shadows die twice and it was like the last boss fight in the game, which I died a lot more. But I feel like Sakura was kind of like what taught me how to handle games like this in the first place. Um I would consider the highest difficulty on God of War, much harder than Ciccarone General, but maybe that's just like a personal thing because I've heard like, people say that sex is like the hardest game like that they've ever played out of everything. But for me, God of war on the highest difficulty is definitely the hardest. I've never had to be like so heart pounding lee, adrenaline pumping, just intensely focused because I know if I make a single mistake that I am going to have to like do this entire thing over and just, oh, it's, it's extremely intense.

I've always struggled with depression, anxiety for like forever, but it's been complicated because at some point in my life, I was very like spiritual and I believe that a lot of things like the secret, the law of attraction, reincarnation and all that, like magical new age stuff and I think that alleviated the symptoms of my depression and anxiety very successfully to the point where it was almost like I didn't have it. Um but then within the last a few years I decided through observation and thinking and looking at everything really closely that none of that stuff was true. Um and I really relied on it to be true. It really gave me security and safety and a sense of purpose and all of that and then it was just gone. Um and but you know, I thought, you know, I know it's gonna be really hard, but you know, I have my fiance sale, I'll be okay like eventually or something, but it didn't really turn out that way. Um because looking at things, I can tell that there are times where I can tell that there's something wrong with my brain, you know, the way that I've been forever that's never really even like looked at or diagnosed by a professional, but where I just don't have interest in doing like pretty much anything or talking to people or hanging out with friends or going out or even doing things with my fiance who is literally the most important thing to my life, you know, I barely even want to get out of the bed in the morning even though I get to wake up next to her, you know, and everything that I've approached with my problems, I've always kind of had the idea. Well, I know there's my brains, okay. I just need help. But I finally, I don't think my brain is okay and it's not just like nobody's going to be able to talk me into looking at the world as if it isn't this justice lys pointless excuse for nothing. It's just like that's not gonna happen because I, my beliefs used to do that and in those beliefs, I was this infinite being who lived forever and reincarnated and life was really about love and growth and beauty and nothing is going to be able to replace that, that's just like mundane. Well, you've just got to be positive because it's the right thing to do. But no, there isn't a point to being positive or happy because there isn't a point to anything, but I think that's because my brain doesn't work right.

Like you really have to go above and beyond. You have to be a very, very puzzle minded person to do these. And the person on the channel who solved them is Sudoku expert. So he would just breeze through it and he would say um he would get stuck only for like under a minute at a time and then he would have this sudden insight and he would explain an incredibly clever technique that he used to find the solution. And I was inspired to try some of these puzzles and I was glad to find that they were actually free. Each puzzle they did was actually linked in the description. And so I went to their official website and I tried some of the puzzles and um I really like doing puzzles. I like things that challenged the mind. Some, some of my favorite video games have complicated puzzles in them. And I really found an interest in these puzzles because they were incredibly complicated, but they were doable. Like I knew that there was an answer. I knew that there was a way of finding out the, the unique rule sets and finding my way through them. And I definitely took a lot longer than the Sudoku expert, but I found a great sense of satisfaction in doing these puzzles and um normally it's hard to start on them. Normally it looks impossible until you start to really think about the rules said and really think, okay what what do I know, how can I figure out what digit I can get in first, Even the first digit is really tough to get.

Um I do have a friend who's incredibly pessimistic, it's very interesting how opposite our personalities and that are in that way. And um I just don't understand that point of view. Um I do understand being realistic about the future and to an extent I do understand being nihilistic or realistic about the future. Um I understand seeing, I understand that the point of view that some people have that technically nothing is worth anything because in the long run everything is meaningless, but I don't apply it to my life. I think that the meaning of life is the meaning that you give life. And so nihilism or nihilism, I never know the correct pronunciation of that is kind of nonsensical to me in that sense, and pessimism doesn't seem to make sense because it almost feels superstitious, li like you're inviting the bad luck in, but also um in a real sense, if you focus on what bad things could happen, then the bad things that do happen are going to stick out more. But if you focus on the good things that can happen, then you're more prone to get pleasant surprises and you're more prone to be happy in the now, which then affects the future, it kind of informs the future to self fulfilling prophecy and I find that being optimistic is something that other people like as well, like if they ask you, how do you think that they'll do on something? If you give them an optimistic answer then they'll react a lot better if then if it's a pessimistic answer, I do find that the realism fits into there as well. If you're if you're optimistic and yet realistic then you can say potential futures that are good, that will make people happy but will also set realistic expectations. Whereas if you're simply pessimistic and not realistic then you're kind of a sad sec as people say. And people don't like that if you're pessimistic and realistic then people still don't like it. They just say like well that's that's the worst that can happen sure but you're not focusing on what could happen, that's good um sort of like uh you know why bother trying will probably fail anyway, like well yes but you'll probably succeed.

I mean of course there are some things beyond my control, but um I can't do anything about those. So I might as well not worry about them, that's the way that I felt ever since I realized as a child that there are some things that I just can't control. And when you're a child you can't control much of anything at all. But the things that I can control, I realized that I either should control them or I'll just have to live with them. For example, I have incredibly noisy neighbors that live upstairs and I can't really control what they do. But I can do certain things like I can call my building manager, but it seems like all they'll do is kind of give them a talking to and they'll say like we weren't doing much of anything and then they'll just retaliate later or I can knock on the ceiling, but then they'll retaliate here and now, or I can find some sort of better solution like running my shower water or something, which they don't like. And I suppose that's a temporary solution, but it does kind of throw them off enough that it quiets them down a little bit. So yeah, there are definitely things that you can do to control the bad things in your life. Sometimes, sometimes you have to find little ways to control the bad things in your life, even though it seems impossible because everything you do does have an effect. Um what I'm trying to say is everything that you do affects the world in some way. And even if something seems incredibly daunting, like your manager at work is getting you to do something and you don't think that there's any way to affect them, They're still human, they're still affected by their environment and there are definitely ways to change their mind. You could talk to them, you could talk to HR you could try working differently, you could try different approaches to your work, to your interactions with them.

So what I'm thinking about doing is buying a cheap house uh that you can get through a city like the city government website and then renovate it and then I have a cheap house, a small house, but it's mine and I don't have to pay as much. Um The reason that I think that will lead to a more satisfying life is because it will solve basically all of the problems that I have nearby, for example, I have incredibly noisy neighbors upstairs, I have noisy neighbors elsewhere within the building, there's a rooster that lives next door that crows outside my window, although I suppose if I move somewhere else, there's the risk of that happening. Um The rent is incredibly expensive and gets more expensive every year. Most of my problems stem from being in a cheap apartment and so getting that houses, I think that one big hurdle that will vastly improve my life satisfaction. I mean, I am really satisfied with my life just because I'm happy to be alive, but that will put me into, I guess a new baseline of satisfaction. Um So my first step towards that goal would be basically just getting money. Um Yeah, I suppose that what I described about getting the house through the city website and renovating it.

My best friend from elementary school into different groups which sort of defined a path that I I yeah, I I won't say that it's necessarily more fringe than I would have gone on my own, but it definitely, you know, cut a clear direction towards you know, more punk rock sort of countercultural leanings and relationships. And uh it worked out well for me. I had another close friend in elementary school who lived behind my house, another house. We had lost touch after being Children together and as I started joining these different groups of friends in junior high and into the beginning of high school. You know my friend had become sort of a background figure. I had sort of very, very not seriously kind of teased him a little bit in the hallways because he was very shy, He would even act very shy to me who had known him for years, you know, just kind of teasing him very lightly, not super mean or anything. Then I started feeling a little bad about even that and feeling bad that I had made that transition into a new social setting so much better than he had and just didn't seem to have a lot of connections or friends in our high school. So I deliberately started engaging with him in the hallway trying to strike up conversations and inviting him out to just anything I could think of. And very slowly I started getting him to agree. And then he'd come with me over to some friends, you know, like punker friends, parents houses where all the kids hung out and he would sit there and he wouldn't talk when they were girls around. But he would sit there and people started getting used to him and talking to him a little bit more when he would get quieter and then they were only boys in the room and he would speak and very slowly he just personality started emerging out of him, became not shy at all, not bashful at all. It it really turned him around in a way that his parents eventually thanked me for and took my mom aside and thanked her for and said they've been thinking about taking them to see psychiatrists and whatnot because they just didn't know what was going to become of him with the intense shyness and, and uh, I had just managed to pull him completely out of that. By the time. By the time we left high school, you know, he was in performing in bands, making music. He's going on to become a very, very influential, very, very fringy kind of post punk guitarist.

So I never really had to study all that much. I just knew most of most of it. So that's the thing. So I had so I never really got a lot of study habits that a lot of people would have by the time they make it to college. And that was the thing I let's see like all I ever had to do was read the material and there you go. I would know it. And the funny thing was that didn't actually change because a week later what had happened was that the science department issued a notice saying that that exam that they had given us was the wrong exam that is it had questions on material that we hadn't studied yet. So we were given questions we weren't supposed to have gotten and they actually changed everyone's grade, disregarding the questions we weren't supposed to have gotten and I ended up with, so I actually ended up with a B. But the fun on that exam, not A. D. But the thing was I ended up getting an A. In the class because I studied harder. That's the thing. So if I, ironically, if I hadn't failed or at least quote unquote failed that exam, I wouldn't have studied harder and I wouldn't have learned that lesson and I wouldn't have gotten an A in that class and potentially my college career in general might have gone a whole lot worse.

What exactly is keeping me from pursuing uh some particular things that I want to pursue in my life? Of course the general answer is my limited resources. So you know, all people have limited resources. For example, we have limited time. I cannot do whatever I want simply because I don't have time for everything. Also my financial sources are limited. So my efforts, my energy, everything is limited. If I have additional hours in my day I think I would be able to do more. But no, I don't have enough energy. I don't have enough time and there is not any way to get this. So I wish I can watch some movies or I wish I can meet my friends more than I meet them. So or maybe I can study something new or I can learn something absolutely new for me. But I cannot simply because I don't have time, sometimes money and sometimes simply energy to do that.

We know you're white, you know, your, you know, your parent, we know you think that you know society is too litigious, we know all these things about you and then we're gonna take your information what you, what you would, how many millions you would pay out or make the tire company, whatever, how many millions you would make payout. And then when they go to make their jury selection, they say, well if you get some, you know, mid forties white woman, she's gonna pay out X. Number of dollars here. And I just, I really felt for the family and I kind of wish I was on an actual jury instead of these mock jury studies. But it was like it had all this evidence. You know, it's so fun, it was a terrible situation really. But it was, it was actually fun to see these real documents, you know, where you had scientific experts come in and they say, well, here's what tire trade ought to look like. And somebody else said, Oh well, but you know, if you're going this fast and it's this hot on the highway, well then here's what's supposed to happen and you see the actual dashcam video, um, of the accident. And so it took me probably should. I don't know, like an hour, hour and 15 minutes. And I was like, I wouldn't, you know, other notifications were popping up like, hey, do something over here, Hey, do something over here. And I was like, no, no man.

Where it's like, you know, you know, people who are just not interested or informed about politics. So they don't really get upset about politics. And if they are upset about politics, it's sort of suspicious because there's not really any reason that they shouldn't feel this strongly about anything. So you try to track it, you know, like I I always encourage everyone to just shoot for as much of a middle as you can, if you're the kind of person that gets drawn towards really damaging media sources, meaning like really fringy right wing media sources that truck and a lot of conspiracy, really misleading, you know, dis informative kind of propaganda really.

I don't think that I mean they weren't at some point, but you know, I was talking to a close relative and it's like, you know, I try to warn them about these things so that you have some sort of media literacy so that at least know where the information is coming from because you know, I constantly hear this, these are my thoughts. No one's putting anything in my head. Get real angry. Very, very taken aback the mirror suggestion that you know, they would be kind of getting brainwashed. But then I'll ask a question like, you know, I don't want you to get upset, but can you tell me who is George Soros and what is a globalist. Well that right there, you're clearly alarmed about a thing that you need to seek a definition on because you don't even know what it means or who it's in reference to. All. You know is that you should be afraid of it. You're coming to me to find out what it is. But you don't trust me about anything I tell you because the main thing I keep telling you is don't listen to the people that are telling you these things because nobody should be as suddenly reactionary as you are being. You know, there's a difference between you know maybe feeling like the country is getting getting crazy and like thinking that civil war is imminent. Like if you suddenly get to the second point from being at the first for many years, you know, if that was happening, I think I'd be aware of it too. I don't think it would matter how siloed our information's sources are if we were actually on the brink of a civil war, I think I would also be aware of it. The fact that you think that we are, it's alarming. Like you've been the pitch of of your concern about politics has been raised way too high, way too fast. And uh so I long story short I called the cable company trying to have these things taken off the T. V. S and they stop confusing the hell out of my relatives. And uh you can't you cannot do that. You cannot you can have it, you can block it yourself. But then if the power flickers cable box turns back on it locks every channel. There's no way to fix that. So literally you just can't you can't just get rid of cable channels that you don't want. Like you have to get all of them. Even if I like just paid for the absolute bottom basement cable package, it still comes with crazy Russian right wing disinformation channels which it's very upsetting.

I wouldn't be so concerned about whether or not I'm going to have enough money at the end of the month for everything.

The first few weeks, month or two were hard, trying to figure out what to do what the best way of doing it was like essentially dog proofing where we lived just to make sure that like the dog was safe, there are still some issues now, but like after a while, once we got used to it, taking care of the dog was a lot easier. We were able to focus more on just the enjoyment of having a dog around and spending time with it than worrying about whether it was safe or if we were doing a good job, those early months of having dog, well the harder because we didn't know who was doing a good job, but now we're able to just focus on the fact that it's nice to have a dog and the comfort it brings.

And I have a difficult time moving from staying at rest, that are that having a difficult time going from rest and move and going in motion. I have a hard time starting and so that has prevented me from pursuing some of the things that I want to in life. A good example of that is piano, I have wanted to learn how to play the piano for years and there have been a number of times that I have started lessons and just stopped after the first lesson or two, I mean literally right after I started and when I was married, we had a grand piano, we had a Steinway grand piano, that was a beautiful piano, that was my ex wife's parents piano that we inherited And my kids had learned how to play on that piano, but none of them took lessons for more than two years. So the majority of our marriage, our 20 year marriage, it literally just sat vacant, no one used it. And so looking back on it, I regret not learning because we have this beautiful piano that I wasted and so now I have this keyboard and I finally finally just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna do it. And I have finally gotten past the first few lessons and I'm now doing it, it's like all I had to do was move past the first few lessons and now that I'm in motion, I have no problem. It's that old thing now that I'm in motion, I can just keep going. But that seems to be the thing that prevents me from pursuing what I want to do in life, just getting started. I have a terrible time doing that. I don't know if other people have that trouble, but for me it's incredibly hard for me to do that. I just can't seem to get going on things.

And the problem they were having was actually a mask a mask question in the class, basically the question was like, oh they're basically the question was asking for the difference between two different two numbers and so what they needed was subtraction and what I found out what they were and they were asking me for help And they and what I discovered they were doing wrong was they were doing the equation backwards. Like instead of trying to subtract 400 from 900, they were trying to subtract 900 from 400. So they ended up with 4 -9, they added backwards. Now the funny thing was, and again this was well before we had learned what negative numbers were. Yes, that that long ago. So so obviously the concept of subtracting a bigger number from a smaller number didn't make any sense at that time. So and and and after I had corrected them, they actually went deeper more in depth and started talking about uh the different problems they had with with math. And it was actually pretty enlightening, I had never seen like what other people talked about math. Honestly, I just assumed people thought math was boring and I guess a lot of people do think that it's boring. But my problem personally, my problem with it as a kid was that it was too easy and that made it boring to me. So I just assumed it was too easy for everyone else to and but turns out that that's not the case and like talking with this one random kid about one random math bro, and again, I don't even live in the same city or state as this other kid and I don't even remember that other kid's name From like 30 some, well okay 20 some years ago.

Thank you. Should still check the billboards on the side of the road that might have an offer for a better deal on a better tv.

Well I've only seen him twice. Once we met it, we first started talking online in april. We met once in May and once at the beginning of july before my birthday, It is now mid December and we haven't seen each other since. Well he had promised me that we were going to see each other on his time off. He had basically from October 31 to November seven off and it was really silly but I wanted to celebrate the Halloween holiday with him. So I was hoping I would see him that day. And of course he was a no show and I don't think he did Jack crap at the house he lives in but he promised that he was gonna make it a point to see me and it was almost towards the unit's vacation. And we still hadn't seen each other and he, during his break he even had to work and had to deal with, he lives with a bunch of family or not, well not family technically he lives with his ex girlfriend's in her family and they always are demanding him do tons of different things around the house. So he hardly ever has any free time between working a construction job for a million hours and struggling with things at home. So I mean I understand why he's so busy, but he had made it a point that he was going to see me. He promised that we were going to see each other and he said he was on his about to, he said, well why don't we see each other tomorrow? And it's always frustrating because I'm trying to make plans with him and set things up like things they need to do on my end or what I'm gonna do once he's here because let's, we made a list of things to do together. Let's actually work on that big list of items instead of just being awkward and maybe eating out somewhere. So he says he's about to leave. But I asked did you see my messages because I found out that I had lost my only debit card a couple of days before. So I had no money technically and he decided, well I don't have much money either. So why don't we save it for another time And it absolutely. I guess you could say even further broke my heart. I feel like he really broke my trust. I mean yes, neither one of us are made of money, but I could have borrowed money from my parents or if say, you know if we hung out the house, I could have ordered food because a lot of the online places don't request to see your card in person while they're at the door. We still could have had fun. We still could have ate here at my house, some eat out food. We could have watched movies, we could hang out hung out. I mean, yeah, we could have really done any of the activities, but heck if he didn't have any money either to drive anywhere because he'd be the one driving and he has the gas. So, so that was, you know, over a month ago. It's, you know, it's been over six months since we've seen each other and I'm honestly still upset. Like I feel like is he ever gonna come through with his promises? Does he ever actually want to be my friend? Does he ever actually want to be more than friends? And it's, it's really hard because of all the other things in my life to keep faith in him. When it feels like he broke my faith, it's like people step on me.

If I stayed in the pessimistic mindset, then I think that the structuring of my life would change into a pessimistic outcome, which means that I think that positivity equals positivity negatively equals negativity and hopefully in the future I will be having a great career that will be going really well.

Uh I like spreadsheets, I like organization and the work that I do requires, you know, in most of the time, laser focus and uh little room for things to go wrong. That being said, I can choose uh my, my parents are older and they lived the next town over from me now and my mother and my stepfather still live in the house that I grew up in and it's a big house and they get older, they should have sold the house probably a long time ago, but they didn't and uh, it's harder for them to move around. The goal was to get the house ready for sale and there were a whole host of things that needed to be done. I put together a big spreadsheet and with the help of my sister with using google sheets, she's further away online, we uh kind of listed all the priorities that needed to be done, starting with some contractors coming in and doing major work on the house that had, you know, been neglected maybe for years and also budgeting that in terms of, you know, what money was available, which, which projects were priorities over other and also, you know, we were trying to get as much done that we could over the spring and the summer before uh colder weather and holidays came around. Uh there was also a lot of financial things to, to consider. Um and then after that was done, we needed a way to find a realtor. I mean actually it was, I didn't really tell you about how time consuming it was to get estimates and all that type of stuff and go down there and meet with. Um, we probably got usually got roughly three estimates for every single job that the house was painted. There was work done on the roof, the driveway, the siding of the house. So some uh, they had had some issues with flooding too. So there was some structural work done in the basement. Um, and that all took a lot of time. Um, and it took a lot of focus and believe me my uh, yeah, it's kind of like I would associate it with being the foreman of a job because sometimes if my mother and my stepfather at that age where it's not going to get done unless you, unless you really take charge and make sure that people are up and ready and able to do what needs to be done. Um, and so towards after all the, we felt that, you know, most of the stuff we needed to do, There were a couple of things we were like, well should we do them or should we wait for the new people to come? And that would be better because then they could have it done the way they want to do and we felt that question could be answered with the realtor, so the next step is getting a realtor and listing the house. Another thing that was on our minds obviously was the condition of the housing market. There were people were getting a lot more than they were asking for their house, so we were trying to get it ready to before some sort of you know, um crap bubble crash that you know might happen. Um And uh my parents haven't sold their house, but and they aren't even sure if they want to move, they really need to, but you know, I can't make that 100% decision for they don't have the legal right, but it is completely ready. Um And if they wanted to leave at this point, they could put it on the market tomorrow and they would be ready to go wherever they needed to go and show it.

So I would say the most recent life experience that I had that was big and shaped me was my breakup with my partner of three years and this happened around a year ago. And at that point in my life I realized that I was very complacent. Um I feel very comfortable with them, I feel very safe with them. Um but that also led to me not really expanding my social circle, learning more than I needed to. Um I didn't really go above and beyond and anything while I was with them and that's not necessarily either of our faults. I guess it was just our first serious relationship and it was easy to get lost in it to the point where it started affecting our individual I guess performances in life for lack of a better word. But I would say that after that breakup, after looking back, so they moved away, they went to johns Hopkins in Maryland for college. Um and I stayed in our hometown. So you know, at first it was like why, how could this happen? I thought we were so good etcetera, etcetera. But then I started looking back a little more critically after I sort of worked through the negative feelings and realized that this was, it could be a period of really good growth for both of us. And that for me personally, it was like I had to be comfortable if I really cared for this person, I had to be comfortable letting them do what they thought was best for their life, which at that point was not continuing the relationship, which I now agree with. Um but it took a while and I would say we're on we're on pretty good terms, you know, we text every once in a while, I still talk to their mom and stuff, we're still family friends, I would say. So he also taught me a lot about like possessive possessiveness and relationships and trust and relationships and like understanding that um the other person doesn't owe you anything and that time spent with them as a gift and that you should cherish it, etcetera, etcetera. So yeah, that's what I would say is the most recent meaningful event that shaped me now.

Um And I had been taking ballet lessons and started having pain in my left knee. Um It started out as just a very mild kind of pinching sensation um under my kind of under my kneecap. And um I had to start sitting out of dance class with an ice pack. And uh then I eventually stopped taking lessons. I had to miss our end of year recital, and I stopped taking lessons. Um And then over the course of the next year I started going to physical therapy, but the pain just kept getting worse and I was getting so discouraged because it hurt to do just ordinary day to day things. Um walking, even just going on walks around my neighborhood because I just, I wanted exercise was painful. Um when I would bend my knee, I could hear like a crunching noise, I guess under my kneecap. And um I just was in constant pain. The whole area around my knee just would hurt. Um There wasn't any visible swelling or redness or anything, so from the outside it looked fine, like I looked fine, but um I was just always in pain and it would keep me up at night, was constantly icing, I tried taking ibuprofen, I tried taking um different pain medications that just didn't seem to touch it. And uh so after that I've been going on for about a year and the physical therapy just wasn't getting me anywhere. I finally had, I got an M. R. I. And my sports medicine doctor that I was seeing at the time told me that the cartilage under my patella was basically had like shredded a little bit and had just been getting thinner and thinner and just kind of like there was some breakage and so that's what the that kind of crunching noise was and so because of that there wasn't as much cushioning between my bones. Um and attendants I guess and so there was just more friction. Um And yeah overall my knee just had less protection when I was active and stuff and I couldn't run without just excruciating pain. So when I was actually I was 15 by the time I think I had the surgery not 1313 was when it started I started having problems with I need but I didn't have surgery till I was 15 and um he I was put to sleep and the doctor went in it was I don't even remember what kind of surgery it was called. Um But he went in with a little scope and basically kinda suctioned out on the loose pieces of cartilage um that were in there and that were I don't really think that that was going to fix the issue. I'm still not really sure why I got that surgery I think that we were hoping that maybe it would help relieve some of the pain but just went in there and removed all the loose pieces of cartilage and then um the recovery process was just extremely difficult. I mean I was bedridden for several days, then I had to wear this huge cast and I was on crutches. Um And for a good year after that, I mean I couldn't do hiking. Um You know, my family likes to go to Colorado and go hiking. I couldn't hike. Um I would have to I had to stay home from hikes a couple of times, um couldn't run, I wasn't dancing anymore. Um walking, It was still painful even after the surgery and I would go to physical therapy, I went back to physical therapy. Um even prescription pain medications just weren't weren't fixing it. So eventually years later now I've been able to build up some muscle and it doesn't bother me quite as much, but for a long time, I mean, I felt like I couldn't, I mean I was 15, I was an active, you know, teenager, but there was a lot that I couldn't do.

And florida is an unusual place and that it's one of the few places that there are not, there's not a lot of competing commercial activity. If you're local, you might buy something. But few people from out of state will go to florida perhaps because transportation out of the state is just so expensive because the state is so long and no one's really close. I mean if you live on the east coast, you're 10 hours away. If you live in the south, you're 10 hours away from the middle of florida. So I had learned in the past and it's a good place to buy because you can get great deals. Unfortunately, there was a teamsters strike going out at the time. So really the two people I work with basically said forget about it. But I knew there was a lot of money to be made here. My boss looked into it and he wasn't going to overrule me, but he basically said it's probably not worth the hassle. I flew down there and lo and behold there was only one other person bidding and he wasn't a store. He was an individual. So I got the stuff for about 15 cents in a dollar. The only deal was we had to get everything out of there in 72 hours, which was impossible with a trucking strike going on. So I called my boss and explained everything and he yelled for a bit and then he listened and he listened some more. And all of a sudden We organized 10 employees from work to fly down there And over three days we rented a bunch of trucks from budget, picked up multiple loads, took them to a couple of storage areas. When we finished loading what we had to take the storage areas, we loaded up to 10 trucks, brought them, brought them all back to the Midwest. We ended up clearing somewhere in the vicinity of $3 million dollars profit out of this deal. The trucking strike ended up a couple of days later, I flew down there the next week, had everything loaded from the storage areas in the trucks. We need to get everything back. It costs a bit more than normal because of the storage areas. It gives our expenses with the budget trucks, but it ended up being one of my most profitable deals ever.

So just being at the game felt really special being with him because I consider that our first game, the first game where you know, I was involved in deciding whether or not we should go and getting the tickets and all that. So, but being at the game itself was something special, you know, being with my dad there and being with all the other fans and watching the game and the atmosphere, everybody around us, it was really kind of like makes you excited and happy and I think because I was sharing with him that it made it very special because you know, I want to share the hobbies that I have to share the hobbies he has, but it's just special to share the hobbies that your father has because you can both bond over it and talk about it all the time. And so I think going to that first game against the new york Islanders was very special and it made me very happy because especially during that entire game, we won the game in the end. So you know, after every goal being able to high five my dad and the guys next to us and you know, just throwing yourself out of the seat after every goal, just looking at my dad and just, you know, the glee on our faces and the high five and you know, pat on the back and at the end of the game we walked out just talking about the game and just the whole car ride home, just talking about the game and it was very special. And you know, that's why from there on out, I've always been looking for more games to go to. We've been to four other games since then.

I think the main one is pots so it takes a while to do and it also can have effect on your body like drowsy and kind of woozy and disoriented. So I haven't been the designated one to go with her. But when you go to an appointment like that for the tilt table, you have to have someone with you who can drive you home just in case you don't feel good. You have nausea.

Um so I spent many years just kind of flitting from one meaningless job to another, mostly in customer service and not paying my bills, just financially destitute. I'd come from a poor background, so there was a lot of that, but I always felt like a lot of my problems were my own doing. It was a result of a lack of maturity and just support in general. So one day, um, I get fired from my job as a web developer, which at that point was the best job I've ever had. It was the best I could have hoped for in a long line of terrible jobs and I get fired from that. And that was my whole identity, you know, at the time because it felt prestigious compared to where I'd come from, I get fired because of what I feel like we're politics, that I just was a casualty of, I'm not really sure, but I'd have to decide what the hell am I gonna do with my life? I can't go back to school. I'm in default on my loans and um interestingly enough, the university where I attended was gonna sue me. They were gonna sue me for some loans I had taken eons ago and randomly one day the lady calls after him, you know, I've lost this job and stuff from the university and she's like, we don't wanna sue you. There's a way that you can get these loans in good standing. Long story short. Um I was able to do that with the Department of Education and I get the loans in good standing, which means I can now apply for financial aid to finish my undergraduate degree And so I go through that process. There was a lot of hiccups along the way and it was very daunting, but it was at that time in my life, it was like my brain finished developing is the best way I can describe it all of a sudden, I just became conscious, I don't, it seems strange to say that, you know, at 29 years old, I was at the time like how did I live my whole life in a dream? But I did and it was because my development was a little delayed because of the alcohol abuse and other stuff. So that was um something this odd moment that should have been really terrible, turned into something really great. Now I have a Master's degree in clinical social work.
