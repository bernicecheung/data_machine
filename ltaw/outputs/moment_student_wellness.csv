We had very different lifestyles and I don't and she was just not ready to be an adult or be responsible and that was very frustrating to me. So we decided to not be friends, not because I didn't want to, but because she was unable to change anything or admit that she had done anything wrong. And so she decided that just never talking to me again was the the answer to her problems. And so that's what happened. And then there was a situation that happened shortly after that where my dad had passed away and she hadn't reached out to me and so there was a lot of resentment from all the things that had gone down and because she didn't reach out in my time of need and we had been really close before this and recently I moved out of the state and right when I moved my friends now started hanging out with that girl again, the one that I said I had issues with and I thought at first that maybe I could handle it, maybe you know, I understand that people should be able to hang out with whoever they want despite how I feel about them. So I was trying to be fair, but I keep seeing these videos and pictures that my friend post of that girl and it just makes me very upset because it brings up the situation that I still have not had any closure from. And it also hurts that those friends that told me that they were on my side and that they couldn't be friends with her because of what she had done to me and that would be going against their morals. That all just went out the window right when I moved and I wasn't physically there. So that's been that made me really upset. To the point where I when I get upset my chest starts to hurt.

Um but I've I've felt when I, when I spoke with my therapist over the last couple of years, I've spoken of the the old physics theory, that things that tend that stay at rest tend to stay at rest and things that are in motion, stay in motion. And I have a difficult time moving from staying at rest, that are that having a difficult time going from rest and move and going in motion. I have a hard time starting and so that has prevented me from pursuing some of the things that I want to in life. A good example of that is piano, I have wanted to learn how to play the piano for years and there have been a number of times that I have started lessons and just stopped after the first lesson or two, I mean literally right after I started and when I was married, we had a grand piano, we had a Steinway grand piano, that was a beautiful piano, that was my ex wife's parents piano that we inherited And my kids had learned how to play on that piano, but none of them took lessons for more than two years. So the majority of our marriage, our 20 year marriage, it literally just sat vacant, no one used it. And so looking back on it, I regret not learning because we have this beautiful piano that I wasted and so now I have this keyboard and I finally finally just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna do it. And I have finally gotten past the first few lessons and I'm now doing it, it's like all I had to do was move past the first few lessons and now that I'm in motion, I have no problem. It's that old thing now that I'm in motion, I can just keep going. But that seems to be the thing that prevents me from pursuing what I want to do in life, just getting started. I have a terrible time doing that. I don't know if other people have that trouble, but for me it's incredibly hard for me to do that. I just can't seem to get going on things. There are a few other things that I want to do and I just can't figure out a way to do it. And maybe what I need to do is just tell people I'm going to do it because there seems to be an accountability involved when you don't say you're going to do it in your head, that you actually go out and tell people, hey, I'm going to do it because they start asking you about it and there's, there's that peer pressure of you are going to do it and maybe that's what I need to do",179.04,484,162.198391420912,"2022-12-19T00:14:37.204Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-8a99a1d5-e815-44ee-a80b-aa762f2b9652/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=606e4eb2a56685e5593304cd&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=639fa6f72c3893a44ff55ac1","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Well-being","Autonomy","What is keeping you from pursuing the things you want to pursue in life?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_19",10,"Yes"

Like instead of trying to subtract 400 from 900, they were trying to subtract 900 from 400. So they ended up with 4 -9, they added backwards.

Honestly, I just assumed people thought math was boring and I guess a lot of people do think that it's boring. But my problem personally, my problem with it as a kid was that it was too easy and that made it boring to me. So I just assumed it was too easy for everyone else to and but turns out that that's not the case and like talking with this one random kid about one random math bro, and again, I don't even live in the same city or state as this other kid and I don't even remember that other kid's name From like 30 some, well okay 20 some years ago.

And um right now, I don't know if it's an oversaturation of information that I received based on the fact that I get this information based on algorithms and computer generated information that's way out of my well, I'm not really technically out of my control, but I guess it's based on the amount of decisions I make a day regarding these searches or whatever you make fine. But anyways, going back to the fact that I'm uh seemingly oversaturated with information in terms of how I should feel about the world and specifically, um given to me. So I would say I'm just very um perplexed. Um but at the same time, um I would say I'm cautiously optimistic about the future. Um because again, I do see the inadequacies that society has nowadays regarding uh the spread of information, for instance, and who owns these quote unquote writes these freedoms that we quote unquote label that aren't really technically freedoms. Um but I would say because of these things, because of the nature of of the leaders that um that are in place right now and that are also trying to be in place in the near future. I don't feel very good about where the future of mankind is heading. Um I would like for this view to change in the future. I would like for me to get to a point where I can be more faithful when it comes to the uh the amount of things that we can accomplish positively and and and um graciously as a society, I don't think I'm at a point right now where I can confidently say I feel good about the future. I really do not. I think it's there's a it's a huge question mark um and it's frankly right now, there's just really, it's just it's not looking like it's getting any better. Um I would mainly want to point out that this is based on what I value and what I value, for instance, may not meet with you value, but um things like good leadership or even the state of the world in terms of not just human uh human existence, but the existence of the actual planet in itself is such a huge question mark, that it's also coupled with the fact of, you know, of all these things happening, you know, climate change and what have you.

It was when I was in this online relationship, we should call it. It was in 2014 when it initially began, but it ended in 2016, basically in an earlier recording, I mentioned how I utilized Michael Jackson dancing and the song Billie Jean to start off as way of coping with bullying. When I was in high school for the first two years, I switched between campuses because there was a dispute between my mother and the apartment manager from where I used to live many years ago. The situation was, there was this girl. Initially we just came along as friends and I only ever saw her in a platonic sense, nothing romantic and she was a fan of Michael Jackson well and good. I like the man, I respect the music and the legacy. So we decided to have this interaction and it became a friendship at first And then long story short, there were stories that she would tell me about being and I apologize for the graphic nature of this discussion. I have to be upfront and honest. She spoke to me about situations where she was engaged in sexual sexual conquests and I will be frank. I was uncomfortable. I listened to them at the time because I wanted to be nice. I did not want to let go of this friendship. Initially I thought it was going to be a healthy friendship, but she would talk to me about being in a sexual relationship with a man who also did an Elvis Presley impersonation. I am B. S. Ng you not. She told me that she was in a relationship with a with a contracted Elvis Presley impersonator. She would talk to me about writing fan fictions about the late Jackson sexual fanfictions, which I really found distasteful. And for some reason in 2015 she decided that she um she decided to confess to me in a sense, I told her I greatly appreciate the thought. It's very flattering, but I only see her as a friend and I hope we can stay friends. The very next day overnight I had an instagram account, an account at the time. That's how we maintained contact overnight and this account is deleted. I replaced it with another which I will not be mentioning. She and another friend left 100 comments and one of my posts. It was just a random post, nothing particularly noteworthy, badmouthing me, making me feel like the worst person in the world. Just because I saw this person only as a friend and she decided to put my manhood put my character, put my integrity into question just because I did not see her. Like that long story short is this whole concourse of drama, a concourse of her claiming that she was suicidal and wanting to go to the hospital. But unfortunately for this person, this individual was making fun of suicide because she was she was only seeking attention. I take suicide and suicide prevention very seriously. And this person was strictly speaking, it just for me to stay on her case. And so after an additional year, because I was foolish enough to forgive her, give her the benefit of the doubt. I tolerated her giving me false messages, seeking my guidance for situations that I took very seriously. But she was just trying to get my attention. She had friends, making me apologize for things I did not do. She cyber stalked me, harassed me. Her family members threatened my life and my family's life. And in April of 2016, I sent her a message under no uncertain terms to leave me alone, never contact me again and to absolutely get out of my life. And then the most recent conversation I had with her took place back in 2016 A friend of hers contacted me blaming me for, oh no, Oh, this is good. I must apologize because there's so much I could talk on. She attempted to catfish me but I reverse searched an image that she put on her profile and it turns out that it was just a random image on Google.

Um what made me upset is that we have not maintained contact for quite some time from 2020 maybe one phone call in 2021 up to 2022. There was no in person communication because she left, she left the school, she went to another neighborhood, she's living there at this time and many changes, I had to improve myself, develop my professional and personal um standing, and she I presumed it the same In 2022, we ended up having a conversation, we ended up having a call, it was completely out of the blue, we were catching up on things rehashing and basically I wanted to check in, she see how she was doing. Um I was hoping that this could be the potential first steps of rekindling our friendship, getting to know each other once more, being able to meet up. But at the end of it, it turned out that she just asked me for some gas money, she was not in a position to pay for that apparently, but I was, so I gave her some lending, it would be a bit too friendly because I doubt that she will pay me back. But that's okay. I'm doing well for myself at this time. But What really got me Angry was that a man who she told me years ago had assaulted her? I worked my hardest to ensure that she would never have to be confronted by the individual ever again.

Every time I watch a game in the N. B. A. Lately, I just get so upset And actually this is a problem in the NFL too. I watch basketball and I watch football. But recently the refereeing has just been out of control. They blame like recent rule changes that have happened. This is going on both sports. Like I said recent rule changes. But it's more than that to me, it's also uneven enforcement of the rules and just like arbitrary penalties and the non calls when people break rules and the referee is just like whatever they don't care. It's very upsetting. I don't know why I get so upset. I mean I am only a spectator. Maybe it's because I've been a player before also, but I don't know. I think it's the most upsetting because you can't do anything about it except just sit there and watch the injustice. Oh man, I still only been talking for a minute, haven't I? Okay. Um, so the referee, let's just be a little more specific Janice antetokounmpo, he'll go through and he'll charge through these people, right? And the referees won't call anything on Janice.

Um But high school I was failing every class is failing every class that I took uh simply because I wasn't there because I was struggling a lot with anxiety and depression. So I would either stay home and just not go or I would go and sit in my counselor's room all day and not go to classes. So you know obviously, you know, even with trying to do makeup work that they would send to me. It is, it's really hard to keep up to date with that stuff when you're not actually in class learning the material because you have to, you know, teach yourself everything, get a little frustrating. Um so it took me five years to graduate high school and after that I went to trade school for biotechnology. Um It was just a one year like nine months trade school and I got my certificate in biotechnology and I worked in that field for about two years, I had an internship um through the trade school, it's kind of part of the curriculum uh in cancer research. And then just about immediately after I got hired at a Marine biology research institute and I worked there for about two years. Um and I really loved it uh for a while, but unfortunately there was an incident in the lab where I had spilled chloroform on myself and in reality, you know, I was safe. The worst thing that could have happened to me was I passed out maybe hit my head or something, but like it really wasn't going to do anything bad to me. Um But I didn't know that and I got really scared and that triggered a lot of anxiety for me and it got really hard to continue working in the lab. And on top of that it was a weird work environment. I don't want to call it toxic, but it was strange and it was clicky and I didn't fit in and I was just not happy there. Um And with being anxious in a lab, I decided this is probably just not the career for me, I don't want to work here and I don't think I want to work in a lab at all.

I was also doing really well in my trade school. Um I was on top of the class, but I, you know, I rediscovered my love for learning and I was getting really good grades.

I grew up a little a little faster than I think I should have had to. Um, and I made it through largely by myself and that has gifted me with a, um, a sense of independence and determination and just sort of mental toughness that I wouldn't have otherwise. And while I don't think that anybody should have to deal with the things that I had to deal with at the ages that I had to deal with them, Those experiences have turned me into the kind of person that I wanted to be when I was at the age that I was going through those things, you know, 12, 13, 14. I've had a lot of the experiences that I was kind of dreaming about having when I was dreaming about, you know, moving away from home and getting out of my home town and going to college.

But there was one day where I was just, I had the painting down on a table instead of up on an easel and I had a really tiny narrow brushes that I was working with to get these beard strands just right and I just kept just one strand at a time, just building this guy's beard. And I did it for probably an hour and a half because I had a double double period in the art room. And when I finally looked up again, the bell had rung for the end of the day, everyone had packed up their stuff, cleaned up their stuff, left the room and were well on their way to packing up their bags and leaving the school. By the time I looked up and realized that the room was empty and the teacher was about to ask me what I was still doing there and I hadn't heard anything. I truly didn't hear anything. It wasn't even like I ignored the chaos, I truly did not hear it. I was so in my head and so focused on what I was doing and immersed in it, that I completely just didn't sense the passage of time at all.

So in other words about a full time work week with some overtime a lot of the time I also work night shifts, so my hours are kind of weird. So that does get in the way of doing certain things, but I'm getting used to working around that. The main, that this issue, I would say it's just money money as in I just don't earn enough money or have enough money to pay all the things I need to pay off. Now. I should clarify by that. I make enough money to pay off my monthly and like weekly costs, but I have a lot of that that I want to pay off and it feels like it's gonna take me many years to pay off this debt. I spent a lot of time thinking about the debt I have to pay off. In fact, I even bother to calculate it all, it's about $70,000 or so or something like that. And while that's not a very huge amount of money, I only make about $35-$40,000 a year. So once you factor in me paying off all my required expenses, it just doesn't seem like I'm making progress on that as one of my main life goals or at least something I want to do someday in the future is possibly moved to a different city.

He is violent and explosive and I, for the life of me could not understand why she would just bring this random guy off the streets and put her kids through this trauma again and it's been one of the most infuriating situations in my life and I love those kids. I actually, she's been essentially neglecting them for a while and it's been infuriating to me because the oldest is the one who's having to pick up all the slack as far as actually having a job paying for the bills, taking care of the two younger ones. The well One is a five year old and a 17 year old, but taking care of the two minors and I have been going over there and bringing her oldest around when she needs to go shopping or anything because she won't allow her to get her license and she keeps holding the car over her and like refusing to take her places when she needs to go them because she's all about her crack addict boyfriend now and where he wants to go and what he wants to do and doesn't care about the one kid that's keeping their house paid for and stable.

Um it's certainly not where I expected, I would be at this point in my life, I am almost 30 years old. Um I went to college for fine arts, ended up getting that degree. My um original thought was to be a professor because I was really into ceramics and painting and I love teaching or anything like that. So I really wanted to get into that, but I found out that to get my masters something that they don't tell you when you start your bachelor's that um for any place to even accept me, I would basically have to take a few years off. I'd have to go do residencies and all sorts of unpaid or low pay things and I had bills coming up. I had student loans due, I couldn't just, you know, run off and do these programs and stuff for a few years until I can get into my master's program that it was just not financially feasible for me. And I was really angry that you know, when you start as or when you're applying to these programs, they don't give you the full scope of what it's like to try to go into the next step. They make it seem like, you know, you finish your degree and then you can get out there and do what you need to do. That was an incredibly infuriating thing. I started out as a pharmacy tech making just a little bit above minimum wage um in retail and then I went to hospital, pharmacy tech work and the pay wasn't getting any better. The only reason that I went there was so that I could have solid hours because in retail my hours kept changing. Um I ended up going to work in a factory as a machine operator. Somehow ended up getting into the lab. It was a little bit of a surprise to me because they required, or it said on the application that they required a degree in biology or agriculture, but because I just had any old degree, they after the second time I tried interviewing with them, they eventually accepted me. I don't know if it was just because they needed somebody and they just didn't have anyone filling the openings. But I went there, I did that for about two or three years. And now I am working quality control for uh sorry, I'm kind of losing my train of thought. I'm working um quality control for um medical clinical trials, basically just reviewing the information and it's it's a good job. Um I'm making a little bit less than I did in the lab, but because of the injury that I had while working in the lab, well it's a lab for a factory, but I had a back injury working there and I can't do physical work anymore. So I had to take about a dollar and some change an hour pay cut to go do this quality control job and it is nice because the hours are flexible and I can do some work from home. The only problem is they won't give me the amount of overtime that I need to compensate for all of the amount of money that I lost from the other job. So I constantly have to pretty much beg for overtime or I have to do things like prolific or sell things or try to find some other like odd job or source of income that I can do. Um But this isn't at all where I thought I would be. I didn't when I started in art school actually also um while I was working at the factory, I did about a semester and a half in health sciences because I eventually wanted to try to be a clinical lab technician. Um I had an issue with that. Um financially I couldn't afford to keep taking the classes. Um It is a full remote program and I do want to get back to take it but I'm just unable to at this point because I can't afford the books and the extra materials and stuff and it's not covered in my financial aid. Um So I've got maybe my first year of that program done. Um I have to do two years of health sciences and then get my certificate and or and two years of health or a year of health sciences and then switch over to clinical lab technology program and then get certified. But um I'm not capable of doing that anymore. So that's another direction I thought my life was going. That kind of got derailed on me.

But regardless, there was a time in my life where I was taking medication for depression, anxiety and sleep and I was on a lot of medications and I ended up getting hospitalized like three or four times because of something called serotonin syndrome.

My heart rate was very high and I was on the verge of a heart attack, but they were able to bring me down and they realized very quickly what was wrong when I told them the medications I was on and I thought that and that, I mean, after I recovered from that, I figured it was just because of the combination of medications I was on. So I got prescribed other medications and then ended up having the same reaction and I would tell doctors that I can't have those type of medications and then it would prescribe medications like that to me anyways.

Um I I guess it's too, I don't know if I'm allowed to do too, but I'll do two. Um So the first one that's really recent within the past couple of days or so, um I recently picked up tennis um I've only played twice so far, but um and I haven't played as a kid um since a kid since I was a kid, but um it's been really fun, I think being able to go outside and go on the tennis court and kind of hit the ball around um is kind of a really fun activity and it involves multiple people, so you can't just do it by yourself, um which is a really fun component. Um I think challenging myself and being able to sprint and hit the ball because um I didn't, like I mentioned before, I didn't really play tennis um growing up, so it definitely had a learning curve and I think I'm still definitely trying to figure out how to hit the ball correctly. Um But yeah, that that's one that I really enjoy, and another hobby that I enjoy is crocheting, I think something that's really fun about crocheting is that you, at the end of it, you have a project, like something that's complete. Um and it's really cool to kind of give that because um being able to gift something like a crochet project is unique and you can't really have um sorry? Um you can't really go wrong with crocheting projects because they always turn out pretty okay, it's like kind of more the thought that counts anyway. Um but I think it's really cool that you can kind of see the work that you've put in, I think um if you play tennis or things like that, of course, you can see the work that you've been putting in by um having better form and technique and being faster and sort of those goals, but with crochet, it's really cool because you have um yeah, these works of art really, um and you can display them and give them and um have really um useful um places for them, like for instance, I have made like little coasters and um little bags for holders and dog sweaters and hats and all of that, so it's really cool to kind of see your own and being able to have that sort of creative outlet is really awesome.",152.28,420,165.48463356974,"2022-12-22T03:46:26.724Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-268788f6-12c1-4fe6-956a-230739e3b197/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=6100544802b385d8df434779&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3cc6ed73c3bde36b85707","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Well-being","Engagement","Describe a recent activity or hobby that you enjoyed.","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_17",24,"Yes"

Um driving in the city makes me anxious and I've been very clear with everybody in my life, you know, don't ask me to drive you into the city. I you know, that's my boundary and so she would need to go to the train station. So I told her, hey, you know, I'll drive you to the target near the city outside of the city and you can get an Uber into the city. It will be significantly cheaper than if we did it all the way from back at college. She said, ok, so we get to the Target and she called the Uber late and Uber says it's gonna take too long to get there. She was gonna miss her train and she just looks at me, her eyes are in a panic and she's just like, I don't think I'm gonna make it, you know, if she misses the train, it's gonna be a lot of money. Well thankfully this was my first time offering to do this for her and I had this little inkling in the back of my mind that this was gonna happen, maybe it was the universe trying to warn me. But I had mentally prepared myself to drive in the city that whole day prior and I said, you know what, it's okay and I drove on the highway, I drove into the city, dropped her off and honestly going into, it wasn't as anxious, but the drive back out of the city, wow, was it just so anxiety inducing? My hands were stiff on the steering wheel was just horrible. But I never told her that I told her that I made it safely home. I told her text me when you get back um to your house, so I know you're safe and that was all and in a way that was a sacrifice I made for her. I I willingly cross that boundary. Um You know, for her for her sake. Um Would I do it again? Well you know, I like to think that it pushed me to drive into the city because of course I would love to drive in the city at some point, I want to get better.

I was trying to reflect on my career with my partner and I was kind of, trying to express that. Yeah, there might have been times when I could have done better, I could have worked harder, there's these people I'm envious of, and when I reflect on the differences between us, it just exists exists, this huge disparity between what they've done, what I've done and it's not just in, hey, they tried harder, maybe I tried just as hard as they did, but they came up with ideas first, like they decided to do this sort of project first, they decided to pursue this kind of opportunity before I did, and it's just always been on the back of my head that perhaps I'll never get ahead in life because I'm not the first to come up with these ideas and I guess the same kind of really applied to entrepreneurship or startups or anything, right? Like this idea that I'm perpetually following someone's footsteps or that I was simply not applying myself to the fullest extent. I'm not prioritizing things that I should, but when I explained this sort of notion to my girlfriend, she told me that it was just kind of, this thing that I had to get over. And the thing was, I do wanna get over this, I'm not proud of it, I'm not sharing this as a motivation, but in the end, the way it came off was that it was immature of me to think this way, um, the word used was high school ish, and it does upset me because the idea was I wanted some sort of reassurance that I was doing fine. It's something that does bother me every single day that I might not be doing enough. So when this sort of insecurity is being called immature, it just devalues the effort I put into the career and the efforts are made to not catch up with certain people, but understand that their approaches to things have worked better than mine and while I've adopted them, I may have just been late to adopt them. So even though I'm doing fine, the constant idea lot, I could be doing more. I'm not sure if it's immature to think that way, when it is a source of insecurity for me, it's not something I want to, but it's something that I guess I'm just stuck with. Is it a source of motivation possibly in the sense that it drives an urgency to do certain things. And it gives me the foresight to compare myself to others and analyzed to see if what they're doing is going to make more successful in love in the long run, such as not closing myself up to not for example, right? Like in undergrad, I was very, very fixated on this one niche of this field, but I realized that it might, the true path to success here was to do whatever, just get a job in anything in this field and the transition there instead of trying to get into it right out of undergrad. So I guess like in that sense, it does give me energy to keep going after I realized like this is the right way to do things, but at the core there's a lot of security that I'm just not doing things right, and I'm not sure if it's mature and empathetic to call some of the security high school ish.",189.08,598,189.760947746985,"2022-12-22T05:24:59.107Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-e83c7c42-f073-4731-8c3c-561bd47bb01c/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5e58cfeeb542010d36f52748&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3dc78f05567575bc8492e","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Well-being","Emotional stability","Describe an event that recently made you upset.

And I had to hike up to this hostel because it was not near the city. So I finally get there and I, I sit down, I get in and everything is great. And uh I started just exploring the area and I hiked up this one local mountain took me about an hour and a half and I got to the top and I just sat there and I was just looking at where I was at, I was just looking at the mountains, I was looking at the little village down below and it almost brought me to tears.

And when I travel I tend to travel for a couple of months at a time. So hopefully if I do Iceland, I can do it in a month. If I do Ireland Scotland in the UK, it's definitely gonna take me at least two months or three months.

I live a very minimalist debt free life, which a lot of people, especially living in southern California where I live, I can say, I don't worry about a whole lot of things. Um, so any kind of money that I get is I'm automatically better off than most of the people that I know, I don't have any recurring debt or anything like that.

Um All throughout the course of that semester, our teacher had informed us, There are no excuses is due on the days due at the time that is due and you either get a pass or fail. It's not even a score. All of our scores came through with all the assignments we were giving to prepare for that senior project. And because I am a computer science graduate, our project was to create a software tool that could be used by businesses. And so all throughout the semester we took our time, we did our, our scopes, we went and did all our research. We put together everything and we were fine tuning everything. Everything was done had been done for a couple of weeks, but we were fine tuning things and the night before the project was due, there was a severe thunderstorm that came through our city and knocked the power out completely. So all the labs that we worked in had been knocked out. People who had not saved their work and didn't have a backup, a copy of it found that when things came back up again, it didn't look right on their screen, stuff was missing. The files had become corrupted. And our senior thesis teacher, he came and he told us it's due tomorrow, no excuses passed or failed. He reminded us of that. Uh and he had worked at IBM. So he was a very astute, very thorough teacher and he would tell us things happen within business all the time, they don't care, they have millions of dollars riding on whatever it is you're working on, sometimes there is no room, you have to have what you need to have or the whole company could be The last word. And so I will never forget. I've never been more focused in my entire life. Thank God I keep copies of everything I had this back in my room that we're not all the changes that we had made to tweak it and make it pretty but it was everything functioning properly. And so we were able to work all night. I worked all night I think um we probably went about 12 hours um non stop where it's like don't talk, don't eat, don't know, we got to focus on making sure everything is perfect before eight a.m. On the next days before that task was stupid. So I was completely and totally focused if it wasn't my partner because we were working in groups of two in terms of just doing our presentations and things with the final products were our own individual products.

So um she was really distressed because both things were things that she wanted to do. She had always said there were things that she wanted to do, but in her particular situation um I advised her to take the medical school thing do the sorority later and thankfully she agreed.

And then of course after they, I received my lupus diagnosis before they passed. Um but then after they passed, my lupus got really bad and so my doctors would not co sign on me being able to return to school full time because they feared that the extra stress on top of working and on top of taking care of my Children would be too much for me, it would continue to trigger my lupus. So that has prevented me from being able to go back to school, it has prevented me from being able to take more positions that would have me traveling as much as I wanted to travel because I always wanted to travel and I was doing that with my job. But then I had to reduce some of that because the doctor said that I was traveling and being around strange people would also trigger my lupus and then because God has a sense of humor, Covid came through and so then everybody started working from home.

And I've been painting a lot recently, not so much recently because I had school but now that I'm on break, I will be painting more. Um So yeah watch has been really fun too get into I guess it's almost like watercolor and acrylic paint combined which are two of my favorite medium, so combined, it's like my ultimate favorite medium now and I think it just has a certain appearance to it that makes your art look opaque in a way like with watercolor when you paint um the paper can kind of shine through because it's a very thin medium and watery. I mean there's ways to change that but with squash I think it's easier to get more of like a saturated look.

I don't want to deal with drunk people. I'm a female like um if something goes wrong um I only have glass in between me any angry drunk could break them, you know. Um But I actually don't want to die driving to work or even driving home in the morning. I mean I captured a whole lot of people driving the next one that are drunk but you never know. Um the people that go out party, but then they work the next morning, you know? Um I, the part that upset me though is it's for my safety but the fact is there, this job I work 60-70 hours a week, sometimes more. I haven't asked for a single day off this year and I put that request off the first week of january last year, like as soon as the calendar because we have a whole calendar for the whole year to request off and I put that up the first week of january and after after my request was put up the first week of january a few months later, somebody Put up requesting that they're going to India for like four months um which they're gone now and they won't be back until early february. And then there's only, so I just leave me and one other person, so it's me and one other person working 24 hours a day and sometimes they call somebody else, so that's a lot of hours. But then to find out that the owners are leaving for christmas which they don't even celebrate christmas, it's not, it's not their religion and they're not coming back to afternoons. So the one day that I requested off all year, they can't even give me that, that really disgust me. You know, I give everything and I give them my literal life. I have no life. I can't do anything. I also can barely afford to live because they barely pay me anything and the fact that they couldn't even give me that one night because I don't feel safe, disgust me. And no, I don't want to stay here the night before. I shouldn't have to, I have animals. I can't leave my I have birds, they can't be alone that long. I have to be home during the day or at least for a good portion of the day. You know, I'm just, I'm still upset about it and I'm not gonna get over it for a long time.

So I wrote a tune that took a tune, I'd written a while ago and wrote it out for big band. We read it and it was like okay no need to change. So I was working on it with my instructor and he was like, hey you should ask the, you know the bandleader to like, you know, get this chart played and I was like maybe thanks, you know, and he was like, oh no, I know, let me do that. So it kind of worked that out and because of a lot of weirdness and you know, it's a good learning experience but I spent a long time 50 not 15, but I don't know, eight or 10 revisions or each time you gotta make the changes, you gotta fix the parts then you gotta, you know, and it was I was using the software I was using was an older version that I like, I still like the interface for more but um because it's older, what wasn't optimized as much. So when you would take what you had on a big score, you know, all the parts on one piece of music or one page and then you get like the individual parts, it would go super slow and too, and it wouldn't automatically do the placements of notes and I mean not notes, but like written like english letter notes that are like, hey, like, you know, this change here, that one there, you know, um, instructions, maybe a better word for it. Um, and all that other stuff in the music. So I'd have to hand do that. That would take hours and print it and then tape the parts that would take hours and we finally got it red. But man, it was grueling every time I have to do that, it was a good exercise. But I have learned a lot about, well, hey, just writing music in general would be like how to optimize what I'm bringing a chart in and making sure that it's as clean as possible before bringing in.

I love the process, I love getting up early and going to the airport usually when I traveled with my sister. So yeah we go to the airport we um we check in, we go through the security then we probably get food if you're that hungry because airport food is expensive. So for that hungry we'll get food, then we'll sit at our gate and we'll wait and just you know let time pass by and just wait and wait and wait. Then we get on the plane, then we put our carry on into the cabin and we sit down and um wait and we watch movies if we're on Delta and we look out the window and we see the beautiful sky and the buildings and the water. Um It's a really good experience to travel. Um So most recently for example I went to where I go, I went to Los cabos. I went to Los cabos from the ninth to the 13th of this month and it was really really good experience um Just being in a different environment and just seeing how people interact in a different culture is really, it's really um interesting and um that's me new people. I don't know it's not something so beautiful about just experiencing something and just moving on with life I guess it's like you know meeting people and then not like you know not staying in touch with them because you don't have their phone number or social media, you have them, you just have them stored in your brain as a memory and I find something that's so cool. I don't know what that's called, I'm sure it's a word for that. But yeah, yeah, traveling is really happy. I love trying new foods. I love experiencing new cultures, the music. When I went to um Aruba, when I went to Mexico, we went to a festival at the hotel, the hotel is all inclusive. It was really, really nice. I felt really comfortable there. People were really great, it was clean and we had an ocean view. Thank you God, so grateful that I got to experience that with my sister. Um hmm. All of a sudden, yeah, we went to a festival there and we had food. Um what do they have? They had flan, they had like chicken cast, Ia's rice, all this good stuff salsa. And um there were, what's it called? Maserati Band, I don't know, but they were dancing. It was these women and men wearing hats and the women were wearing um like long flowy dresses and they're dancing and singing. It's good experience. And I also went um Kimmel back writing and I went on a tv and it was really cool and um sidetrack like we went to this beach called Lovers Beach and me and my sister felt like kim Kardashian because for some reason, I guess the men, there weren't really used to seeing like black women, I guess, and they're asking to take pictures with us, and we said yes, but I was kind of like, what are they gonna do with these photos, You know? But I don't know, it's really interesting and they want to fix with us. Um I honestly like the attention to, like, because I feel like in where I live now, people are used to seeing women like us, so, you know, we're not really admired like that. So we went to a different country, it was like, oh, like, if I stayed here, I stayed there for, like, a month guarantee you, I would have been married In that month. But anyways, yeah, yeah, so traveling makes me really happy. I love experiencing new food, culture, music, and serving the people there. It's really, it makes me really feel complete, like it makes me really feel happy, and I'm just really thankful that I got to experience that, and I'm really thankful that I get to experience more in 2023, it's gonna be a great year.

I. But I'm gonna be real here, okay I'm gonna be real. So This was years ago maybe like 2019. Um So basically I was dating the sky. We're kind of on and off for a year and you know towards the end we stopped talking and I had a dream. I had a dream that I went to the doctor's office and they told me that I had an STD and I felt when I woke up when I woke up I felt so strongly like I felt like this is a sign that I need to get tested and see if I'm you know clean whatever so blah blah blah. Um within a week I think I got tested. And to my surprise I came back and I did have an S. T. D. And I knew I got it from my ex because I only did it to people in my life. And the first one I dated was a version and there was a large gap between that. So I just knew it was the second guy because he had a history of you know not being honest and you know sleeping around and stuff but I was 1918 so I didn't really you know I wasn't that smart. I guess you could say so yeah when I figured out I had this I got a phone call I didn't answer the phone but I was scared because I knew if I knew if they called you that means that there was something on your test that they need to talk to you about. So I missed the call. That's all crap. That probably means I have it. So I called her back and she told me that I did have a STD and how did I handle this? I cried in the car because I cried because my intuition was telling me that when I was dating this guy he was just not it, but I let his words, unless his words, you know um um what's the word? Allah His words influence me when I knew that deep down he really wasn't someone I should be messing with. Yeah. So when I figured out I cried then I texted him and told him what happened. And he's just so because I told him and he literally tried to lie about it. Like he tried to lie about it and I just knew I knew it was him. I haven't been with anybody else but him but he tried to lie about it and he was just so nonchalant and it was just so gross like you're really playing with my health and your your athletics a joke basically. But yeah, so I made an appointment to you know, get that taken care of um I took, it was like it was like two pills I took and it was gone and I blocked him. I blocked him completely. I mean before this happened, he was blocked for a few months because we're having issues, whatever, but this time I actually actually blocked him on everything. I blocked him. So he emailed me and was apologizing basically still lying. He was like, oh, I'm sorry that I acted so nonchalant that day. I promise, I didn't give it to you. I got tested in never month, I got tested and it came back um clean. But of course he had no documents to back it up. You know, doctors give you documents to show you your record. They don't just tell you on the phone, you know, I had records, but apparently he didn't have any records. It was like, you're lying because doctors giving records, you don't go to the doctor, that's why you don't have any records and you're a liar. So yeah, after this I really just, I was just done. I was done feeling like crap. I, I started to journal, I started to eat healthier. I went on walks early in the morning. I was also during quarantine as well, so it's kind of easier to take care of myself. I started working more. Um I really just took a step back and just was trying to fix my mental because I just couldn't believe that someone would be such a liar, you know? But yeah, this was my journey of when I really started to, you know, get like, get a relationship with the source, you know, God, the universe, whatever this is, when I really started to like Journal and stuff and learn more about myself and spirituality, and I'm really grateful that that happened to me because that was the path of where I am now spiritually.

And um I ended up going to the urgent care more frequently with extremely high pain. Um I do have days where I am completely productive and I'm excited about that. I have a huge food trigger list that I am strict about um things on there like, oh, beans, nuts, seeds, soft cheeses, onions are a no go, which gives me um condiments and dressings and anything that says spices are not allowed. Uh no bananas, no pizza, although I can tolerate mellow mushroom because they don't have as much yeast and stuff in there. Anything that's pickled is a problem. But we do, I am able to eat the homemade pickles that my husband makes because they have a different kind of vinegar in it. Um, so am I optimistic? It's really hard to constantly have to worry after you've had breakfast where you're gonna be for lunch, you've had lunch where you're gonna be for dinner if you're out and you've missed one of those, you're gonna have to have something to eat because then my head hurts. So that's a problem. And not being able to work is a huge problem and then add all that to the fact that so much ship is going around in this world. Our climate is fucked up. Our politics are completely crazed. We've got people like trump and de Santis and crews and so many others like goodness. Gates is still walking free and he's a pedophile. How is that possible? How is it that the government can take away reproductive rights? How is it anybody's business what anyone does in their bedroom unless it is harming someone else. There's a reason they say two consenting adults and not one consenting adult and another party that you can take advantage of and abuse. We have the rich just getting more and more wealthy about paying taxes and people who are working for $12 an hour. And those are the people who are actually running our country. We don't want people to have an abortion. So that means more Children, but we don't want to educate them. So that means more uneducated poor people who we don't want to pay or give medical benefits to. So then we have more homeless, which ends up affecting our environment tremendously. And then more deaths, which then people can get on their soapbox and you know, just go on and on about how sad it is when really they're the ones that cost it. It's a it's a domino effect and people need to get out of the way and tax the rich, get out of the bedrooms, get out of education.",299.08,619,124.180821184967,"2022-12-26T00:25:35.892Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-32d880be-8eb6-4bfe-9226-348e28ea8021/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=610ec37ea0648de28b37fb83&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a8e2b4ede22ada94cda187","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Well-being","Optimism","Do you feel optimistic about the future?

Um, I was a virgin before meeting him. I had never partaken in any sexual activities or viewed any um, sexual content? Um, my boyfriend was the same, the latter regarding the latter. He was a virgin as well, but I suppose he would watch pornography. Um, and he, yeah, there's something he did um, personally, I did not like that. It it made me uncomfortable, especially with us being in a, once we began dating. Um, I expressed that I didn't feel comfortable being with someone who viewed people in intimate, like engaging in an intimacy. Um, and he understood, but I, I mean, I suppose he had been doing it for years, so he um really expressed his, his his how difficult it was for him and he told me it was he wanted more than anything to make the effort, but that it was very, um, it was foreign for him to not do, especially when let's say um pleasuring himself, I suppose he had been used to always watching that kind of content. Um, and my boyfriend also, I think he struggled a lot mentally because I also have mental issues in this department, but I would kind of not kind of, I, I even took issue if he and this is very unhealthy, but I didn't like, I thought that if you're with me and you tell me that you're attracted to me can why is it that you have the capacity to feel attraction toward? And I know this sounds so ridiculous in hindsight, but I would say if you look at like a beautiful woman, are you telling me that you actually acknowledge those feelings of her being beautiful or that you can feel maybe sexually attracted to her. And at first my boyfriend, he, um, he didn't quite know when we were first getting to know each other. He didn't quite know that the depths of my mind and the ways in which it works. But he would be completely honest and say like, yes, I can look at another one even though I think you are the most beautiful girl in the world. I can look at another woman and and find her attractive or even feel sexual, sexual, maybe some sort of sexual feelings. But he, he would say these are just thoughts and they're very brief. They're not anything on which I would act. Um, but that would destroy me. Um, so my boyfriend and I, we ended up having to really talk about this because um, I mean early on in our relationship it was starting to have problems and affect him and me. But um, regarding him, he was, he was in a very, and I hate myself for putting him there. He was in a very dark place because he felt that he was some sort of monster, some sort of villainous person for having or under experiencing sexual feeling sexual attraction or undergoing these, these sexual, the sexual, I just, we have to talk about this and I had to, he explained to me that he, he hated himself for for not being able to control feeling sexual thoughts or, or or having them and, and that he wanted to be the perfect for me. But he felt like he would never be able to with this mind that he had after so many years of doing these things and always being accustomed to it. Um, and I went talking to him about these problems, I realized that I was being detrimental both to him and myself, but more importantly to him. And that I needed to, I needed to reassess how I felt about these things and understand that just because I didn't grow up with them like these, these experiences or these feelings and though I couldn't identify with them, that didn't mean that other people didn't.

Um, and I guess maybe part of that is, um, being in graduate school, which has been really difficult, especially during the pandemic and with some other life events that happened, Um, in the last couple of years, alongside that, um that are unrelated and, um I think, because the programme has been so difficult, I wondered whether I had made the right choice in coming here and whether I was going to also be unhappy in my career after this, but I think, um, feeling a bit more optimistic about the job prospects and just knowing that I can, um I don't have to stay at a job like I have to stay. I feel anyway, I have to stay in this programme, um, to completion. So I think once I have a little bit more autonomy to sort of make career changes, um and things I'll be happier. And, um, I think after I graduate from this programme, I'm gonna have a lot of opportunity. As far as work goes, I'm also in a relationship that I feel really good about, um, much better than previous relationships. And I'm working through some sort of bad habits that I think have been learned.

Is that going to be okay? And that held my interest and made me not do stuff because I had anxiety over that situation. I run into that kind of stuff a lot. Um, I'm a very kind person. I think these that's what people tell me. I have a little bit of emotional intelligence, but I don't I'm not cognizant of that of myself very often. So, for example, I'll be like, very upset at something, and I'll know that I had this feeling and I'll know that something is wrong, but I won't realise or know how to describe that feeling until several days have passed. And then, yes, I acknowledge that feeling now. But then I have a hard time naturally feeling it. So then I I get caught up in my my stuff, and it doesn't end up being resolved, and I don't feel better at the end of it. I can't address it properly. I can just know that it happened. And there's no real feeling those feelings that can make me a difficult person, um, to have difficult emotional situations with, um And it makes me difficult in, you know, like relationships. Because a lot of people wouldn't know what I'm thinking. Why I'm acting this way. Um, and I just I can't say anything until several days later, and by then, you know, they've been stressing for a long time. Um, I'm a very messy person. Um, my room is never organised. I wish it was, but it's not. Um, I'm naive in a lot of ways. Um, you know, I like to think that people are good and that people, you know, what they say is what they mean, But I'm finding out that that is not the case, and that is jarring for me because I know in most cases with most people, it doesn't matter that much they can. They can lie to you, and it's not really that important. But sometimes that light is significant and it's hard for me to tell and then I end up messing something up. Um, I'm very dedicated to the things that I want to do. I'm a very hold walk away. But I also have to be engaged. And if that engagement lacks is then I become a very lazy vocal. Um, sure, I'm I would say very emotionally strong. I've gone through a lot of things I've been dealing with like depression anxiety for a long time, and I've dealt with emotional abuse as well, and I come out for it for the battle. But I can also be very abrasive when you know I know I want something and I'll say it. I'll be very blunt about it, have a whole time changing my world to be appealing to people, and that can upset the balance of that interaction with that person and make them more upset.",270.46,596,132.219182134142,"2022-12-27T21:56:09.576Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-a9f3a2fb-c2c0-4fbf-b4de-f83002172518/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=610485c989e3235b4c954535&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63ab6477fff1470b2e65da4a","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Well-being","Self-esteem","How would you describe yourself as a person?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_12",12,"Yes"

I was enraged. In fact, I was hurt and knowing that all of this could have been stopped so much earlier.
