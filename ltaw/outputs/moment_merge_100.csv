It's funny because when I started playing the game, I played it on basically hard and there was like a very hard difficulty. And I had a friend who told me that while playing on normal difficulty that they had like failed this boss fight like over and over and over and over again and on hard difficulty, I was able to get through that boss fight and like I think three attempts and I was really proud of myself and I was proud of myself in general of how I was doing in the game. So I was like you know, I'll try it, I'll try it on very hard, it can't be that much harder can it? But no it's it's not just very hard, it's like insane difficulty, it's extremely punishing. Where if you you have to like do things completely differently and if you make the slightest mistake then you take an absurd amount of damage and you will get one shot or two shot and it's it's really hard but it will make you very good at the game. And other games like it um there were bus fights where I don't think I've ever been so intensely focused on anything in my life and I was like doing these boss fights where like my heart was pounding and I was just like tightly gripping the controller and I was just there was nothing but me and like the movements in the game and dodging the right attacks and pairing the right attacks. I think the only other thing that came close to it was another game called seccuro shadows die twice and it was like the last boss fight in the game, which I died a lot more. But I feel like Sakura was kind of like what taught me how to handle games like this in the first place. Um I would consider the highest difficulty on God of War, much harder than Ciccarone General, but maybe that's just like a personal thing because I've heard like, people say that sex is like the hardest game like that they've ever played out of everything. But for me, God of war on the highest difficulty is definitely the hardest. I've never had to be like so heart pounding lee, adrenaline pumping, just intensely focused because I know if I make a single mistake that I am going to have to like do this entire thing over and just, oh, it's, it's extremely intense.

I've always struggled with depression, anxiety for like forever, but it's been complicated because at some point in my life, I was very like spiritual and I believe that a lot of things like the secret, the law of attraction, reincarnation and all that, like magical new age stuff and I think that alleviated the symptoms of my depression and anxiety very successfully to the point where it was almost like I didn't have it. Um but then within the last a few years I decided through observation and thinking and looking at everything really closely that none of that stuff was true. Um and I really relied on it to be true. It really gave me security and safety and a sense of purpose and all of that and then it was just gone. Um and but you know, I thought, you know, I know it's gonna be really hard, but you know, I have my fiance sale, I'll be okay like eventually or something, but it didn't really turn out that way. Um because looking at things, I can tell that there are times where I can tell that there's something wrong with my brain, you know, the way that I've been forever that's never really even like looked at or diagnosed by a professional, but where I just don't have interest in doing like pretty much anything or talking to people or hanging out with friends or going out or even doing things with my fiance who is literally the most important thing to my life, you know, I barely even want to get out of the bed in the morning even though I get to wake up next to her, you know, and everything that I've approached with my problems, I've always kind of had the idea. Well, I know there's my brains, okay. I just need help. But I finally, I don't think my brain is okay and it's not just like nobody's going to be able to talk me into looking at the world as if it isn't this justice lys pointless excuse for nothing. It's just like that's not gonna happen because I, my beliefs used to do that and in those beliefs, I was this infinite being who lived forever and reincarnated and life was really about love and growth and beauty and nothing is going to be able to replace that, that's just like mundane. Well, you've just got to be positive because it's the right thing to do. But no, there isn't a point to being positive or happy because there isn't a point to anything, but I think that's because my brain doesn't work right. Um and that was like a really big, that was a really big thing.
