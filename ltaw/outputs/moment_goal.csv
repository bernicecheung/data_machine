So what I'm thinking about doing is buying a cheap house uh that you can get through a city like the city government website and then renovate it and then I have a cheap house, a small house, but it's mine and I don't have to pay as much. Um The reason that I think that will lead to a more satisfying life is because it will solve basically all of the problems that I have nearby, for example, I have incredibly noisy neighbors upstairs, I have noisy neighbors elsewhere within the building, there's a rooster that lives next door that crows outside my window, although I suppose if I move somewhere else, there's the risk of that happening. Um The rent is incredibly expensive and gets more expensive every year. Most of my problems stem from being in a cheap apartment and so getting that houses, I think that one big hurdle that will vastly improve my life satisfaction. I mean, I am really satisfied with my life just because I'm happy to be alive, but that will put me into, I guess a new baseline of satisfaction. Um So my first step towards that goal would be basically just getting money. Um Yeah, I suppose that what I described about getting the house through the city website and renovating it.

Like um for example eating food is obviously a need that is absolutely necessary, but like I don't know like say having a having a girlfriend or something or having a wife, well that's it's nice to have um it's not absolutely necessary for survival.

Um The minimum wage is pretty high compared to where we used to live in pennsylvania and in Georgia, we went from making like 14 $15 an hour to like 20 to $26 an hour on average. So we increased our income pretty significantly. Um But I would definitely, my first step would be to move out of Washington state and possibly move somewhere where there's a more diverse crowd of people, better food, better community. We've already talked about moving somewhere like Dallas or Houston texas or possibly uh phoenix Arizona. Um There's better, well not better weather, but there's warmer weather there. I mean obviously phoenix has the best weather in terms of natural disasters because they don't really have any um which has been hard for us because I don't really want to live anywhere where there are natural disasters, but you know, it's so cold here.

Um, so my first step toward my goal of getting back on track is to re establish a schedule and a discipline.

And then I start writing, I write first in english and then I write in spanish and then I read a certain number of pages in an english language book, a certain number of pages in the spanish language book and then prepare for my conversation. I have an hour long conversation every day with the Venezuelan. So I read on up on Venezuelan and mexican latin, american politics.

Um I'll be able to enjoy the time and the memories and everything I'm able to do with them during that time and just overall um feel like I am living a life, a life of worth and there's value in it instead of just being a regular, simple life where everyone else is kind of in the same boat um like me um so I know it's kind of extreme but that would be you know, definitely my first step towards a satisfying life is just kind of you know, quit my job and not have any sort of responsibilities and kind of live free and kind of do what I want to do and not worry about anything or anyone else.",127.05,410,193.624557260921,"2022-12-19T00:48:48.909Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-2b78f035-f588-4cee-95c5-5cfb0b7f8a79/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5ecd4acdb218ec085c6eefe6&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=639fa67d81bcca54a685240a","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",24,"No"

Um, Probably the reason I'm not in the place that I always thought, you know, wanted to be when I was younger is a chronic illness that I have been dealing with for more than 20 years now, which really set me off my path and uh, there's a limit to what I'm able to do physically and um it's taken its toll over the years for sure, but I it is my goal to have a more satisfying life. There's no, if um, but I would say keeping that in mind that I know that in my situation right now, if I want to make things better for myself, my first step would absolutely be to not isolate when I in, in, you know, when I'm inclined to do so, and to get out to be with people, um to try and meet new people and have new experiences that can open doors um, to other things or just for the sheer um social aspect of it to keep myself in good spirits and uh, you know, be among other people. I feel that that would be the first step really. Um, because nothing, not much happens when you're just alone in in your thoughts, um, you really have to take an active handle. Um, uh, you know, if you want things to be better figuring, figuring out what it is that you want and then trying to do your best to get there. So I would say for, for this question again, it would be to get out and not try to not isolate and meet people and network and uh, that would also include um, perhaps traveling more and, you know, meeting some people, um or going to places and experiencing things out outside of the, the normal realm of, you know, where where I go and who I'm with on an everyday basis. Um, I think that would give me more happiness and open up new perspectives and different, different environments and different people and places. Um, probably would in the short term, make me happy, but also in the long term, give me a better perspective and um generally, uh, I don't know.

Yeah, more secure financial foundation there and purchasing the land to basically get away from the rat race. Yeah, yeah.

And um you know the most important first step is work extra hard, work, long hours like work Elon musk hours like you gotta just aggressively go after it and really really want it and you need to make that money and do the best you can with the time that's given to you because life, life could just disappear tomorrow.

And so there's always things to do around here, like go to the shooting range or go to the military museum and uh, there's a park where you can walk around and it's like a quarter mile or whatever it is. Um, and so I think I think about this all the time is if I had more time, it didn't work so much. I would get out and meet more people and I do try to get out and go to church functions and neighborhood block parties and all that and just to get out and meet meet people because I've lived here for about a year and a half now. Um, and things are different now too because of the stupid virus and the some people they took the Covid vaccine and I don't trust the Covid vaccine. So, um, and also right now, I think my options are kind of limited because I'm older and you know, when I was younger I had a lot of friends and you know, it was easier to find a boyfriend where now that I'm older, it's not so easy. Um, but I guess that would be, um, the steps I would take would be just to get out more and be more social and I do try to do that. And also because of my health problems.

It would depend a lot if they let me take breaks whenever I needed to to eat to keep my blood sugar.

I'm assuming you're even judging me listening to this, but, um, for me, it would be losing weight, and there's many reasons why that's so. It's not because I'm, like, morbidly obese, but I'm definitely not in great shape. And I don't feel physically my best or my most beautiful and right or wrong. That has always been like the lynch pin that I feel would help me solve a lot of problems, like being more social in the real world and then going out to seek a mate because I don't even really put effort into that. I don't know what I'm expecting, but um I don't really date because I don't like how I look and I don't feel awesome all the time. And then my weight has caused me some physical issues as well. So I don't feel physically fit, I guess. And then, you know, there's, of course, the self-esteem aspect as well. So I've I've thought a lot about that and realised, like, what is actually holding you back? Well, it's my weight and and and I guess more, more, more deeply. I don't know, more genuinely, it's how I feel about my weight. Um, So I've worked with my doctor recently on, you know, a plan for that, and I'm making progress. So I feel like I've taken a step in that. And then, um, but that would be the biggest one. And then, you know, everything else that I'm doing is per far as personal improvement, like, you know, doing a good job at my job and working on this tiny house and learning things about construction science and, like how to care for a home and whatever. Those things are already things that are happening and those feel easy to me. The weight has not been easy. I'm sure there's a tonne of reasons why that's so probably one is the fact that I don't drink anymore, I guess I've replaced that with food. Um, but I feel like if that if I could get that started, you know, just, be at a healthier weight, or that a weight that I was not sad about then that everything else would, like start falling into place because I'd go out and meet more people, be more willing to do social stuff because I don't like people taking pictures of me or you know, other things.

But I think that um to get to that next stage in life, to get to a more satisfying life um I have to break these barriers, I have to let go of whatever Kwame or whatever issues I may have with keeping these things up in rigid um and just sort of just tear them down as I go through life. Um So that way it's much easier for me to have that satisfaction in life um and not be held by these self limiting beliefs or these ideas that um I can't do something or you know, whatever that may be. I think that would be my first step towards that goal. Um Yeah, I also a good backup step would be maybe, you know, seeking actual therapy. Um Not because I feel like I need it, although I think we all needed to a certain degree. Um but also because I can I can talk to someone who could probably look at my life and and no a way to articulate rationally what it is exactly. That maybe would be a good first step for for me being, having a more satisfying life that maybe I just did not consider, um that would also be a good first step.",120.79,297,147.528768937826,"2022-12-20T00:57:49.529Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-e993551b-d55e-4e2b-bcbf-639036977559/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=59d5c894c732930001d88b5e&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a0fa77e7d2e9f57c09d0e5","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",23,"Yes"

So to lead a more satisfying life now, what I like to do is go back to school and work on tech, constantly see new job openings and people being successful in the field, all the perks of it, like working at home, that could provide a lot of stability for me. That would be very much needed and make my life a lot more satisfying would allow me more breathing room with my finances would give me something to look forward to.

So that would be step 1 100% because if I did that, I could focus on things that I really wanted to do or at least focus on going back to school, which I had to quit for this job, I had Children, I was married, I couldn't do both, so I did the one that would provide, but if I didn't have to worry about that, you know, if I could or if my goals were oriented in a way where I knew that if I focused on a more satisfying life that it would be more satisfying for everybody, then yes, step one would be 100% being quitting that job because that job right now is such a, since a mental drain on me that when I get home I can't do anything else but go to sleep and then when I wake up I want to spend a few hours, I do have with my Children, so I don't have any time for personal goals at the moment, but if I got rid of that, I would be able to focus on going back to school on doing stuff I like on making myself grow as a person. You know, Sadly we live in a world where financial security is the most important thing, and if you have a job that provides that, leaving it to focus on yourself is very selfish. You know, I wouldn't relegate my Children to the gutter because I was upset with my job, but if I was able to, that would 100% be the first thing I would do for that goal.",106.74,363,204.047217537943,"2022-12-20T21:03:31.160Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-3804cff1-98a2-42bf-b479-ce97728f4ab3/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5d909be93113b700156fcaeb&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a21e383b9cb18a540e963e","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",16,"No"

But this job is a career to me and um my title does not appropriate reflect everything that I do at my job and it's not just a paycheck that I need, I do need the paycheck, but it's also just a way for me to utilize my skills, to utilize my analytical analytical abilities to utilize my brain. And I also like the social aspects of being a manager in terms of, you know, leading other people and being there to support them during their day at work. So I think my first step would be, I've already acknowledged that I need to leave and I've already acknowledged that I need to find another job. But my problem is that my job currently allows me to work remotely and I don't have to do the typical 8 30 to 5. I am able to come in later and then take breaks throughout the day to help my Children and then work later on into the evening when they go to sleep. And there are no other jobs in my area that I know of currently that would allow me to have that schedule.

I can't get surgery from my back. I was born with scoliosis. I have a severe spinal deformity, which means I can't stand or walk any significant difference, any significant distance. And um, my life would be more satisfying if I didn't live with pain all the time, but I do. Um, so I think what I try to do is focus on the things that I enjoy and spend as much time possible on those things as I can. Um I try to organize my day so that all my chores are done in the morning when I had the most energy and the least amount of pain and try to get everything done by lunchtime and then in the afternoon I get to devote my time to things that give me pleasure like reading and crossword puzzles, binge, watching, streaming tv, you know, just petting with my dogs, taking a nap, whatever it is.

Because the first step is to organize my thinking. What have I experienced so far? That makes me feel satisfied. For example fishing, why do I feel satisfied fishing? Because I have peace and quiet because I enjoy the thrill of catching a big fish, reeling it in being patient and fighting it. Am I more excited with the thrill? Does that excitement make me feel satisfied? And so that's how I think, Yeah, that would be my first step, just organizing events throughout my life and further analyzing those events to see what exactly makes these events so satisfying for me and getting into the thick of it and sorting out those little details so I can take further steps",94.92,199,125.790139064475,"2022-12-20T21:07:56.289Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-407b2f12-3bf8-424b-9dd1-d6606fba3b35/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=629e241d171ec6698e05f149&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a21f5474d293a74d6aff39","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",33,"No"

But anyway my goal, if it were the case for a more satisfying life, I think my first step would just be to start writing down, what is it that we mean? What is the uh what is the objective? What is what do I view is the outcome that would happen for more satisfying life again? What does it even mean? Um write that down and then kind of just brainstorm what what are things that meet that criteria and what steps need to be taken to get that, and then each of those, I would break those down further to try to see. So for example, if my uh more satisfying life were to find a new job, which it isn't, what I would do is say, well what what is that job? Okay, what is that I want to actually do?

Um, for me, it would just be spending time with my wife and not being broke. So, um, I guess my goal would have to be to have a decent job so that I can spend more time with my wife. So she would work less since I've been, uh, messed up after having my kidney disease and everything. I have not been back to work. I've only just now here within the last few months, even started feeling like my old self again again after I quit taking my medications against my doctor's orders again, I'll listen to myself next time before I ever listen to a doctor just because they went to school does not mean they know anything, but that's neither here nor there.

Things become very black and white to you. And it's hard to see a lot of gray in anything. It just becomes kind of like it's either this or this and your mind just kind of gets that way.

I will take the time that I have now to invest in money making machines, investing in profitable skills, meeting the appropriate mentors and partners who will help me to do better with my finances, both current and future money.

Once I do not have to worry about keeping the lights on whether once I do not have to worry about getting food for myself and my loved ones, then I can spend a little bit less time on that and focus more on other things that matter.

So my first goal is actually the goal I previously had, owning your own home means you don't have to pay rent right now. We pay a considerable amount of rent. Um utilities are actually probably third highest in, in the entire United States. I mean, it doesn't seem like a lot being around 14 kW, 14 cents per kilowatt hour for electric, but it's actually really, really high. Even Vegas doesn't pay that much. Yeah, the first step would probably be getting the house and the first step would probably be getting my credit back in line. Although I would have to say uh that's probably a couple years off right now. It's not like I have a bad credit rating, it's just ah it needs more of a work history add to do it, aside from what I'm currently doing, they just like, most banks will look at me and like, well technically you're working under the table for this business and you're working at this business, you're not getting enough hours, you're not getting enough money how you can afford a house and I'm sitting there thinking, well uh freaking house around here like 30 grand dude, it's not like that ship is expensive and then they'll counter with, oh well the houses are actually 90 grand and I'm like yeah, if you want to overspend for some dumb shed realtor who's actually going to try to overcharge you for the middle of nowhere. But the first step would be getting the credit directly in line so I can get a decent loan for the home. Uh The other option would literally just be saved up money and buy the home straight out. None of that, you know, going through the bank stuff, just save up the money, buy a house once you get a solid investment platform like that, it's an asset. Yeah, you have to maintain it but it's an incredibly powerful asset, especially with how house prices are eventually going to crash and they're just gonna jump back up again because you damn well know, you know they're going to pull that legal inflation bullshit.

The the one thing that would really make my life more satisfying is if I could uh sleep consistently well every night, every week, every month. The one thing I've struggled with for years is is having erratic sleep patterns. And I used some sleep supplements and by following a routine I'm able to fall asleep fairly fairly fast within a few minutes, you know by exercising at the same time and not eating past a certain time and turning off tv and computer by a certain time. So I have a good routine uh including a nice hot shower allows me to fall asleep every night. The problem is staying asleep and you know I'll wake up five hours, six hours, seven hours. Um Not multiple times, but I'll wake up at some point and if I'm lucky I'll fall back asleep. But often I have to get up, have a drink of water, drink some milk and maybe take another over the counter sleep supplement. And this means that the quality of my sleep differs the length of my sleep differs. I mean I might sleep seven hours, one night, eight hours on the night and a half hours another night and so on and so forth. So obviously in the nights when I sleep straight through where I sleep longer, I feel better and I'm more alert and I have more energy and I have more optimistic about life. And also, as undoubtedly, many people have discovered when you have, when you wake up really have trouble falling asleep, you tend to have negative thoughts. It's just natural and you tend to have negative thoughts about yourself and your life, other people that you would not have had if you slept straight through. So, although my life is uh organized and together and you know, well in place in many ways I need to be able to sleep, get better quality sleep and more sleep on an ongoing basis.

I regularly go to the doctor, I regularly get tested. I regularly get um medical procedures done on me and I hope that one day that it will resolve some of the issues I have to make my life a little bit more satisfying. Um in other areas, I'm kind of struggling because my medical issues are um pretty difficult. So it's hard for me to focus on like money or finances or nicer clothes or nicer materialistic stuff. None of that matters to me really. It would be nice if I could have it and I could afford it. But at the end of the day, if I don't take care of my body and make sure my health is okay, There's no point in that if I don't take care of my body and I die, what's the point of having all this nice stuff? So My first step is to make sure I take my medicine. 2nd step is to make sure I'm in communication with my doctors all the time. 3rd step, I show up to my medical procedures, I do what the doctors tell me and I deal with things I have to deal with. So that would be my first step towards a more satisfying life and trying to resolve some of the issues I have is just um, little steps, 11 little step at a time will get you to a lot of stuff.",106.02,293,165.817770232032,"2022-12-21T19:03:30.186Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-718bdcbc-7b00-4fe6-b9d8-0e58145b54d0/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5d7ff85ffec5620017b07c40&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3533439be4c2f4d61487a","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",8,"No"

Like, people don't realize how much negativity in your thoughts about yourself and about situations affect you, so if you always look at the situations that are happening in your life from a positive perspective, it literally will change your life to me, that is what is the way to a healthy, happy, satisfying life is to be positive because it really does affect everything about you.

It's a hard one, It was a hard one for me for a long time to say what your goal is to live a more satisfying life, but I think I'm gonna say it again, it starts at your mindset in your, your mindset and what you really, truly want to do with your life. I think that is the first step is to control your mind and control your emotions, know your emotions, know the person that you are and I think that goes a very long way and living a satisfying life. That's the first step. But I do think there's many other steps you have to take that truly, okay, you got your mind control, you know who you are, you know your limits, you don't know, you're like, you don't, you know your limits, you know what you want. That's what the first goal is. I think in life, and then from that point you just start working at it, you just come up, okay, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do this by this certain time if I fail, that's fine and we can do, I can just set it back more. You can't get disappointed in life because you're not going to live a satisfying life disappointment happens, you're gonna end up being a miserable person if you dwell on a disappointment, like I used to for many years and you can't let other influences really judge what's satisfying to you necessarily. I think that's a hard thing to, because there's so many voices of the outside world, whether it's your family, your friends, the internet, you know, the right into twitter's, you know, music, like negative music, negative or really sure, I think you have to really truly know who you are and you can see that stuff from afar early and not really based on fact, like, you know, there's these horrible words going on like in the Ukraine, you know, there's there's just all horrible things that happen to people, but you can't you have to separate yourself that that's not your life, You're living this life and this is what you want, you can't worry what they're doing on that side or if you don't really feel that pull that really help make sure you feel bad about it. But that doesn't mean you should shut your life and shut yourself down because you're living, you're fortunate to be living in a good situation. A lot of cases. I'm not saying that it's like that for everybody, but in my situation in general, I have had the opportunity to live a fantastic life and I think I just let other influences get to me thinking that I don't deserve this life that I shouldn't be feeling like this, I shouldn't want this, I should just go fight the world and not contribute to society boy in the end.

I know that's not realistic, but like that is what I would need for a satisfying life. Otherwise I just feel like I'm constantly going to be working for someone else, working myself to the bone, constantly working. Like it's honestly just depressing. Like my life would be way more satisfying if I didn't have to work if I didn't have these stressors, you know, that's, that's really it. I would love to not work.

Why on earth are you forcing yourself to stick with something that doesn't bring you pleasure and happiness? So I guess my answer to this question is basically I already feel my life is about as satisfying as it possibly could be. Um from an outside perspective, I'm sure what most people would tell you is that I need more relationships in my life and more stability in my life. Um I spend a ton of time alone and I'm super happy with that and it doesn't bother me that I don't have connections with other people, but most outsiders would say that I need more connections with people and that I probably would be a happier and more well rounded person if I actually interacted with others. So I guess if I wanted to pursue that, my my first goal would be to like, I don't know, engage in some sort of activity where I meet other people and try to actually spend time with them and make some close friends, but that doesn't seem super appealing for me, so I'm unlikely to do that. I guess the only other thing that would make my life more satisfying is having more money so I could do even more things, but I feel like just the process of earning more money would make my life less satisfying. Like I would have to work more or have a more stable job that I can't just leave on a whim.

And then that failure could feel like a setback, which could be de motivating. So for me, it's smarter to create a list of more manageable goals in the timeline that they have to be created. That way, I can cross off those small goals and each time I cross off one of those small called small goals.

And I guess my first step would be talking to more people in this club trying to be close with them. Another step would be to have more money. Ah they say money doesn't buy happiness, but I was pretty happy whenever I was making bank of next step on that, I don't know, I already started school back to school, I'm gonna get my Bachelor's in cybersecurity or a computer science degree and work on towards that.

I don't miss that many personalities that I have to deal with face to face on a daily basis and um you know, so that would be the first step toward a more satisfying life, is actually performing well enough at this job coming up that I can turn it into something more lucrative so that I have enough money. I just want enough money to pay my bills and a little bit extra. I always say I don't need to be rich and it's because like, I really don't like, I don't want to be in a position where I'm huge amounts of responsibility on me, you know, I'm dealing with some responsibility is fine, but at my age, I am not trying to get a whole other career as big as the first one was, so more meaningful work.

Um I can't really afford one in the area I currently rent in, but in general, for a more satisfying life, I've always wanted a home, I've always wanted a place to call my own, a place to, to decorate and make feel like home, a place that I don't have to worry about any sort of rental restrictions. I don't have to be with my parents and have to worry about their, you know, input on on what my space is gonna be.

I mean I am stuck in my hometown for most of the year. I travel maybe one week out of the year, so to be able to go to different places would be exciting. And my first step toward achieving that goal would be towards to save more money. It would mean sacrificing things like going out for dinner on the weekends or you know, to buy certain treats here and there, I would have to really make sure I budgeted carefully and put all my money away and put it in a savings account so I would have more money to travel because right now I don't have the discretionary budget to be able to travel more than once or so a year on vacation. If I were to take multiple vacations a year to make life more satisfying, I would definitely need to start working towards that by budgeting my money a little bit better and sacrificing things in the present time to save up for traveling in the future. So my first step would be to open up a separate account and to put money in there every month that could, you know, pay toward my travel bills, whether I was flying or just driving.

Um not necessarily like the people directly around me where I know that they have issues and problems that they're dealing with as well, but more so people I maybe went to high school or college with that, it just seems like they're so much further ahead in life than me and it really kind of makes me feel dissatisfied and disgruntled about my own life. I think one of the first things that I would really do is probably delete social media. I do think, although it's nice to keep in touch with family and friends occasionally, it's really gotten to a point that social media is more about showing off everything that you have will not talking about the bad aspects of things you're going through social media makes everyone's life seem a lot better and a lot more glamorous than it truly is. Um, so I think my first step honestly would be just deleting social media altogether and just keeping in touch with people I want to be in touch with as needed. Um, if I want to do that again, I think I'd get rid of a lot of my comparison issues with other people because I just feel sometimes like the people around me um that are again more distant acquaintances, but people that I see that are my age are just what feels like so much further ahead. They have a house there engaged, getting married, having kids. So I have a really hard time with comparing myself to others and I think that I would lead a more satisfying life if I was able to just kind of put that side and worry about what's going on in my life and where I'm at in life.

I have never been the guy that needs to have the biggest house or the shiniest toys or the newest car in the perfect enviable existence for me, that's never been satisfying. It's just stuff for me. It's always been about the time, you know, the time to be able to spend it with my wife. I would rather have less money and more time to spend it and enjoy it. Ak being able to take the extra week of vacation or take special trips here or there then to have all the money and none of the time. And so I have always pursued the idea of how little can I actually have to work while still being able to live and also have enough for emergencies and extra. That has always been Michael, a lower stress life. Um four years ago I took that first step. My wife was injured at work and actually, no, not scott, it's been seven years, seven years ago, my wife was injured at work and when she got her worker's comp settlement after a pure level of hell, she uh went back to college and I pay, I worked my butt off making sure bills were paid so she could go to college and now she's got the good job. Now she's the breadwinner and by extension I work class and I I worry about taking care of the house, I have more free time to worry about things that matter to me and you know, that's my side projects, my writing and things like that, You know my cooking and I don't worry about advancement at work. I don't care if they promote me, I just want a reasonable fair wage and that's all I care about. I don't want a promotion quite frankly. It falls in my lap Sure, but I don't care about that anymore because we already have that with her career. And so that's really what, and that's what I would advise anyone. Do you want a more satisfying life? Stop working so much, stop worrying about what your neighbors got or what your buddies got. Like if it's just you and your spouse or your girlfriend, You don't need $200,000 worth of income unless really a house, you know, unless big break perfect house is your goal. But if you want to be happy, no, no earn less, have more time to yourself. You'll be stress free or lower stress and you'll be happier. That's all that mattered to me. Is it For me? It's been about time and I have taken that step to the satisfying life. I, you know, I at this point I'm probably kind of repeating myself, but I just, it wasn't even a second, there wasn't even a second thought when my wife and I launched this plan, we, we knew what we were doing, I knew that for four years that was going to be difficult for me because I was working towards the goal that I couldn't see and I had to have faith that we were going to hit, and then, you know, she got the job and we were able to roll everything eventually into that. And, you know, my trust in her was, was justified. And, and it's very satisfying on its own, just the fact that these, this plan came to fruition. So yeah, that was my first step and uh, it's paid off.",253,590,139.920948616601,"2022-12-21T19:21:46.726Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-4e19bec2-32b4-4215-897e-10aa1cc66352/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5edb6d2469290d00092100f8&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a354e93b6dfe0602b85711","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",23,"No"

So something where either got to be outside or working with my hands or something as simple as, you know, working at like a canoe or kayak outlet where we just run into people or maybe take them on tours and things like that and wouldn't make a lot of money, but I'd come home every day happy and feeling like I had, you know, gotten to physically move around and work and be active and just sitting in front of a computer and then do something I'd love and care about and like and being outdoors and helping people um be engaged with the outdoors and with nature and that would probably be my first step, but then I would have a lot more stress about my financial situation.

People don't really consider how much time is spent mindlessly either scrolling on your laptop or your phone or when you don't have any to complete this in 30 minutes, you might end up spending more time on it than what is necessary. So time management would be my first step towards a more satisfying life because we often think about, oh, I wish I had time to do this or to do that when reality we do, but we just don't manage our time wisely. So I used to have a planner and I was very um particular about putting my routine in and then for some reason I fell off. That's something that I'm actually in the process of doing again.

So and secondly our property would stop being around individuals who are not on the same level as goal oriented as me. The reason why is because these individuals will do nothing but distract me from trying to reach my goals, because they don't care about me trying to reach my goals, especially if they don't have any ambition or they're not going to orient themselves. So that would be the second step I would take. Then the third step I will also take once again, is to readjust how I'm using my 24 hours of the day. Now I know if I want to wish this goal once again, I would have to spend way less time on leisure activities and more time on goal oriented activities, and I do believe that's how most people become successful.

When it only lives in two dimensions, walks up to the wall and can turn left or right and all of a sudden a flea appears and disappears and appears and disappears because the flea lives in three dimensions and he hops over the wall appears and disappears. I always thought there were only three dimensions. But the older I get and the more I've watched people die and the more I've read about death and dying, the more I realized there's 1/4 dimension. The fifth dimension, maybe 1/6 dimension, It's that lower right quadrant where we don't know what we don't know because our brains are incapable of knowing what is out there. Like how a cat can see colors that we can't see. So my satisfying life would be to spend more time seeking out and understanding the fourth dimension. I don't think I can get any further than that without going to heaven. But I believe that there is 1/4 dimension among us for all the ways that mom, even though she's been passed for so many years, she still communicates with me for all the ways for all the coincidences that aren't coincidental because of what dimension you'd have to be blind not to see it.

Your first step towards that goal should be creating an action plan. If you want your life to be more satisfying for you, you need to think about what will allow that to happen. What will be the reason that your life is more satisfying when and once you figure that out, that's when you start making your plan and okay, so say for example, say hey I'd like to have more, I'd like a promotion at work or something like that. Okay, so that's your goal and that will lead to a more satisfying life. Well how do we get the promotion? Well we're gonna have to show our ability in our day to day job and we're gonna have to go above and beyond. It'd be better than the competition and that kind of thing. So that's what you gotta do, you gotta figure out what the goal is, that's first two that's going to lead to more satisfaction and then once you figure out what that goal is, that's when you can start to make a step by step plan and that can be for anything. Like say hey I want to save $10,000. Okay well how are you going to get there? It's the same kind of thing. It's just like you have to first figure out what's going to make you satisfied and then from there start planning accordingly. So like for the $10,000. Okay well what I'm gonna do, I've got like $1000. Okay cool, I'm gonna put this into account into an account and I'm not going to touch it and every month or every week or every two weeks when you get paid to work, whatever the case may be, take some money, put it into that account. Hopefully it's gaining a little interest and you know, eventually depending on how much you're able to contribute, you can reach your goal and it's the same with anything.

So, um, since my job is to do purchasing and put orders through when sales people submit them to check them, there were orders coming through, there wasn't something to be ordered. There wasn't much to do. I got up at eight a.m. Every day, which was sleeping in for two hours for me. Um, I would open my laptop quick check to see if there was nothing to do and then I could make breakfast for my wife and I made lunch and dinner for us every single day because I was there during that time I got chores and I got back into playing guitar and started um, refurbishing guitars as a hobby. Um, I was arrested. I was happy. I got to take the dogs out all the time. So all those things that my wife has to do because she's the one that works from home and I'm not there to do it. I got to do. So her life was better in my life was better. It was literally the best six weeks of my entire adult life. So that kind of proves to me that the most important step towards me having a satisfying life would be not working. I'm not one of those people who thinks it's necessary. I'm not one of those perfect people that derives purpose from it. I think it's sad if you think your purpose in life is to work. Um you know, people talk a big game about how like, you know, family, friends like those, those are the important things in life, but we prioritize work above all those things. Even if we say we don't because we have to go to the job and spend our time in our lives doing that job. So no matter what we what lip service, we pay to those things, their actual priority, use your work. And that sucks because it's not the most important thing. It's the thing I do to make the rest of the things in my life possible and that's it. It doesn't define me, I don't care about it, I'm not, I can, I can, I can stop doing it tomorrow and be happier for the rest of my life. So that is the very first step.

And I would solve that by thinking about what jobs are necessary in the area, or how can I just earn extra income, for example, like this, and then that would also include implementing ways to realistically achieve that. So one way might be asking someone else about their own experiences in earning extra amount of money or how, how they got a higher paying job and taking those experiences and seeing if I can apply it to myself or not.

What can I do to make myself feel better? What can I do to make myself feel more successful or happier or more fulfilled? I, you know, I think you just can't get there from here. There's a, in the teachings of jesus, he once said those who save their life will lose it, but those who lose their life will find it, and I think there's some deep wisdom there, um happiness and satisfaction and what measure I've been able to understand it and pursue it and and acquire it. Happiness and satisfaction are a byproduct, not a prime product in other words. Um you find satisfaction after you pursue some things that are not necessarily selfish. I think everybody knows the feeling of making a sacrifice for the good of another person without thinking about what you're getting out of it. And you find later when you look over your shoulder that was a very satisfying experience and that I think is just true across the board. Um You know, one of the you know, happiest experiences of my life, well, multiple happy experiences in my life have been when I've worked with people I care about on a project that we all value. And I've forgotten about my individual goals and I've lost my identity in the group effort, worked together, collaborated with others and achieve something better than any of us could have hoped to do on our own. Certainly better than I could have done on my own. And and then I looked back and I go, that was a blast. I just really enjoyed doing that with people. And and then when I look at the product, you know, for example, I'm thinking some musical efforts, I go, um I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. So that's just, you know, one example I could give out of many, but I believe that that's how to have a satisfying life is not by pursuing it for yourself, but by trying to build satisfaction in the lives of other people around you and trying to devote yourself to doing that with them and allowing them to devote themselves to doing that with you.

Like I, I already know that all I have to do is a couple of minutes of exercise every day, a couple of minutes of meditation every day.

And the satisfaction comes from acceptance of the way things are and realizing that if you, if you want to think of everything as deficient, then that's how you're going to feel. But if you think of everything in your life is sufficient then or even more than sufficient. I mean, I talked about needs versus wants in the last clip too, I have everything I need for sure and more beyond that most people I know do and some people of course do not and some people really struggle with feeding their kids and their families and meeting their basic needs, but I'm and that's that's a terrible situation that we all have to be concerned about.

It doesn't have to be high paid the minimum wage, I don't want it to be part time, I don't I don't need massive income Um because I have investments and stuff like that, but it's something in between, you know, and I don't want to work 60 hours a week, be nice if I've never in my life had a job that I actually look forward to going to. I've always been miserable in my jobs, so that would be great. So the first step would be to just somehow figure out how to make that happen. Um I don't even know, I always have this vague thoughts that sometimes I think being a teacher would be fun and then I think well the teaching part would be fun, but that sort of babysitting part, maybe not so much. Um Sometimes I think it involved working more or less alone, you know, rather than dealing with the social anxiety of dealing with other people I don't know. Um But it might, and it might just actually involve just going back to school, not full four year school or anything like that, but taking some courses in something or other and finding some kind of job and just being comfortable with that and then feeling like I'm more like I'm just sat for the I don't have to worry about money again, I don't want to be rich, I don't care, but I don't feel that anxiety of stuff. Plus I'd also get more contact with other people, I'd be out there and I'd be more proud of what I did for a living right now.

So yeah I'm pretty satisfied with my life if you're saying what could make my life more satisfying possibly a new job, better jobs where I'm not as frustrated, I could be wrong. I like the job that I have, I work as a scheduler or logistics scheduler or a paratransit company. So I am very helpful to the community and helping people get around into locations or whatever but jobs just a stress ball and you're always constantly told you have to do better, do better, you have to make things better. Yeah and nothing's ever good enough. It's where so like um you know you raise up one thing and do a lot better there and they say oh well this sucks too, so you have to work on this. So you work on that and then the thing that you originally raised up has to suffer a little bit because you're working on other things.

I'm I'm great with research, finding, digging down and finding things and I love genealogy and I would love to work on family trees for a living. I guess I would have to get certified and that does take at least a year to get certified. So maybe I should start working on that now. But there's there's lots of things I can do, but there's also lots of things that are sort of holding me back. So I guess the goals would be to go to the doctor and find try to find a cure or a medicine or a procedure that could make me be able to live a little better and then start working toward getting a job that I could do possibly from home in research or with um family trees.

I should put it on a t shirt. So yeah, it's just, and I mean, I know I have the willpower because when there's something happens that I really absolutely have to do it, do it, then I can do it. So I just gotta think how important it is and and stop getting over these. There's crime in our area and this is the most crime ridden place we've ever lived and I somehow in the back of my mind think think that, well I'm a disabled person and a woman and an older woman, so I'm a target already and I just had this incredible, terrible inner demon that's telling me that if you lose weight and you start looking good, then you're gonna be even more of a target because you'll be easier to kidnap obviously than a big girl. Um, you know, at least it's just uh, it's unrealistic, so to speak. It's, it's probably would never come to fruition, but it's just a little thing that bothers me. So I think that's keeping me fat and happy and fat and safe, like they say. Um, but we're, you know, when we, when we go to places and stuff, I just really wish I, you could wear shorts and, and, and um, dresses and look really, really cute and make my husband really proud about my body because I know he's not anymore. I was really, really had a great body when we met but that was before the disability started. Um So and I and I smoked back then so I didn't eat a lot but anyway that's the first step and I've it's I've thought of nothing, nothing else For the last month or two Um about this year, this coming year I'm gonna start doing even if it's just 30 minutes a day doing something and getting moving and get myself in shape, at least get myself. I mean I don't have to be skinny and I don't have to get in great shape, just have to be stronger and work on my core and ah get more limber and then hopefully being less pain.

If I really wanted a satisfying life, um, I have to caution you guys as researchers to remember that a life where some people are happy while the rest are struggling and miserable. A life where some people feel like suicide is the only option to deal with the pain. That's not a good life. Um, not to advocate communism, at least not the way that it has been traditionally implemented. Um, but the collective is important. You can't just think about yourself. You do have to rely on other people to help you out in your life and you got to help other people out because we're all in this together. So the way that our world is the world, the way our world is now, it's not really conducive to, um, a globally collective, like, um, satisfaction, I guess. Um, so I guess to keep it brief, my only way to a satisfying life is through road piece where everybody is happy and getting along. But as I am aware, and as I hope you guys are aware, realistically, we're not gonna have a piece. Especially not with 7,000,000,008 billion of us on this planet for a very long time.

So I would say fitness schedule and then also sleep schedule is just so important, like yesterday I slept till two PM. Today I woke up at like eight a.m. It's just, it's all over the place. So I think getting that consistency in my life would really really help me have the worst satisfying life. Um Also just being outside every single day, at least for like 15 minutes in the morning or in the afternoon, getting that sunshine really helps me, it makes me feel awake, makes you feel live and just connected to nature. Um I can keep going. Um I I need goals, so if your goal is more satisfying, like so my first goal would be to set goals um because I just feel so lost and I have so many things that I want to do, but it's just so much that it's overwhelming, so setting specific goals for specific time periods, like timeframes will really help me work towards them and see what I wanna do and feel satisfied when I do complete those goals. Um what else? Um Probably just reading and educating myself more just about everything. I just want to know more things about how to you know cope with certain things and yeah I guess therapy also would be really good for me and it would definitely help me live a more satisfying life so exercise, sleep schedule therapy going outside.

As far as my personality goes, I have to have to learn to let go of issues um on that previous question, I mentioned that I was a thinker and like to contemplate things before making decision. Well that has its drawbacks too, especially when things may not go particularly well, I end up dwelling on them forever. And that's not a way to live a life. And I catch myself doing it. And I think as I've gotten older, I've figured out ways to move beyond them. I'm moving beyond the issues that really, you know, or pitfalls in life. So that's what I would say about that. Another step I would say is I've explored those things that have really interested me in life. You know, I've always been interested in spiritualism and what happens to us after we die. And I think the more satisfying life, I want to explore that even more. What ties us all together? What happens when we die? Each religion believes something different? Well, is there any evidence out there information out there that brings us all together instead of divides us? And um I would like to spend more time doing that. I've only done that to a small degree. And I think if I really spend some time doing it, I spend some time researching, I think I would find something that would bring bring you the greatest satisfaction. So those are the things that I would say to be the first step towards more satisfying life. I want to be the best husband and the best father and grandfather I can be.

I have almost everything I want, especially like the best husband for 25 years than anybody could hope for. Great best friend I've had for 40 years. I got like you know I've early retired like my my goal my ducks in a row, everything's good. My life is very happy. My health is good. So if my goal is a more satisfying life, I think that dealing with my A. D. D. And my sort of addiction to things online in general, not dangerous things online just like surfing all day instead of reading and other things that I cared to do more in the eighties and and all when when life was easier and not so not so internet ID and so what I need to do is I proved to myself in 2019 that if I used a bullet journal and really focused in the morning when I get up on the things that I want to do that day that I mean I am retired and I don't require that I do things all day and be useful constantly. But I don't want to just a person who who gets to the end of their life and looks back and says what did I do for the last 30 years of my life and find that it was, I surfed on reddit and watched Youtube videos and I mean I don't tend to watch tv. So I have so much of a problem with that. But I don't get out a lot and do other things but I have plenty of hobbies and things I'd like to do and I look over at my embroidery, I'm a painter who showed at galleries but I'm not painting much currently because I just get up and kind of I'm lazy, I started like during the pandemic thinking oh well you know we're all we're all shut shut in for a while so we'll just I'll just kind of take this as a long vacation from doing anything useful but that long vacation became longer and longer and then I just kind of got out of the habit of doing things that were anything that that was difficult. You know like if I think about painting on instead of painting I'll be like oh I'll do that after I do some puzzles online or after I read some posts or whatever it is, you know? And so my first step towards that goal is that I am getting a digital digital bullet journal because I find that probably would be easier for me to deal with since I tend to be online a lot and I'm gonna be going back to that habit of checking things off every day, getting up in the morning and setting sort of an intention. This is what I wanna do. These are the three or four things I want to get done with my day and checking those off and making sure things get done if they don't get carried forward because I just tend to be very easily distractible and very easily very easily. Tell myself I'll clean for 10 minutes and then I'll sit down for 10 minutes and then I clean for 10 minutes and I sit down for three hours and so I need to, I need to make my life, I need to say you should be your own ceo and that you should, you should like both be kind of like the worker and the ceo, you should not only live for today, but you should also live for. You should, you should do some things that make you happy today, but you should also do some things that make you happier that you did them at the end of the day and some sometimes that's not the same thing. Sometimes you want to sit there and eat potato chips and watch netflix, but by the end of the day you wish you had painted or than other things that you intended to do. So I'm gonna try to get those two things more in line and be able to do some things every day that I enjoy doing and also some things that I would prefer to have done by the time I go to bed",210.98,734,208.740164944545,"2022-12-21T21:26:45.775Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-e53cce4a-fb61-4dce-8d7e-711444de7608/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5fefa70c30cadfb105b65915&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a371a3329d07cc9d183bcd","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",34,"No"

And I think a big part of that is because I'm just not where I'm meant to be. And so my first step toward finding greater satisfaction in life would be figuring out where I belong, where I should be because it's definitely not here. I grew up in, I was born in new york and I grew up in florida and a really kind of isolated area where, you know, there was no trick or treating when I was a kid because there were no other houses around, there wasn't, you know, you didn't have a friend next door, you could run down and see. So I grew up really isolated and florida just has, I didn't like it as a kid so much and I just, it hasn't gotten any better. It has gotten worse as it's gotten busier and more political. It's just, it's not the place for me. The only thing I like about florida is that I have a couple of family members here and that I'm super hyper fixated and obsessed with Disney world because I grew up going there so often. So it's kind of like it's my happy place and I am in some ways one of those Disney adults, but if it weren't for Disney and my couple of family members, I can see myself just about anywhere else over florida. Um probably nowhere in the south because I did spend a couple of years living in the Augusta Georgia area and the south, the politics in the south aren't great just like the politics in florida are awful. I am not a straight person, I'm a queer woman and is it's kind of really scary these days being in florida and being female and not straight. Um the rhetoric is getting worse. There is I mean last time I went to pride in my area I got yelled at by a protester when I left you know stuff like that is becoming more and more prevalent. So I would love to find somewhere more progressive to live definitely somewhere with cooler temperatures because I also do not tolerate heat. Well so again florida just yeah not great is there somewhere with um someone more progressive politically more liberal, more accepting and some were younger because where I live in this part of Southwestern florida it's mostly very rich retirees and again just not my my sort of place.

If someone is in a good mood, I would like to mirror their their mood to be on kind of like the same level of their energy. If you know I guess that's the best way I can describe it to me. That would be a very satisfying life is to improve the mood of others so that everyone is also having a satisfying life but also for myself independently not be affected by other people mood. Ah I feel as if people are uh in a good mood if they're happy, I feel that they are more giving more willing to understand others um more accepting. Um I feel as people would uh be more uh nurturing.

You know, like being able to do what you love 24/7 and make a good living out of it is the, I feel like it would be the most satisfying thing in life besides, you know, your own family, raising a family and stuff like that. So you know, I've always had these ideas constantly wanted to do it, but I've never actually made the leap. So for me the first step would be actually to make that leap, you know, I filed all the paperwork online, the business has everything it needs to be to be legit, but just for whatever reason, getting it launched online has been um an obstacle, for whatever reason, so for me that would be absolutely the first step um to kinda take, you know, the side household, this hobby that I love and turn it into a full time thing, a business that I can kind of pass along to my kids",92.72,244,157.894736842105,"2022-12-21T22:11:41.648Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-cd024f56-7d51-486c-a93f-7e6f620e88a5/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5ee68971dde4ef4056079287&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3803ac80f10b45bf54cf9","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",23,"No"

Those are the things that make me feel the most comfortable, which of course is the most satisfying so to expand on that. I think when you are stressed with either medical bills or huge debts or um job loss, that makes you feel very unsatisfied with your life. If you can have the savings put aside and you can have your bills paid, you feel like you're you can pretty much tackle anything. So an example I give is let's say you're you're driving along and you get a flat tire, if you don't have any savings put aside and you're struggling financially, that becomes a huge huge deal. But if you've prepared and you've put money aside and you've got a savings built up, then it just becomes an annoyance.

I, I'd like to write a movie script. I would like to travel more places. I'd like to learn how to cook really well. I mean I'm an okay cook, but I'd really like to be able to cook well.

And so my first step would be to make sure I work a job that makes me happy and if I don't work a job that makes me happy, I need to be making steps to get to a job that makes me happy. For example, if I was working a job that didn't make me happy, I would be applying for other jobs and maybe you know, maybe taking time off work to, I mean don't tell your employer this, but you know making an excuse and try to um go to as many job interviews as you can and you know, spend your lunch break applying to new jobs or another option would be going to school again, so you can get a better job.

Obviously moving to a bigger city like that would require me to make more money, but overall I think I would rather be in a big city and have more things to do. I consider moving to phoenix Arizona or possibly some city in California, I'm not quite sure, but the point, the main thing is part of having more satisfying life for me would be moving to a bigger city where there are more things to do and also I would love to be able to afford my own property.

Do we, are we disorganized? Yes. So how do we bring organization? How do we thin out our possessions so that it's not overwhelming so that we're not spending time when we could be playing a board game as a family, stressing about having to clean or feeling so overwhelmed that all you do is sit on the couch and look at the mess because that's a pretty typical response. Um but that would be my goal is to really go through the house, find a spot for stuff.

I need to have a garden because I love to grow plants, tomatoes and peppers and things and herbs and that would be great. Now I have flowers blooming so that's what I'd like to have a yard. I'd like to have a hot tub. They need that for all my aches and pains now that I'm older and have our own place so that we don't have to worry about anything that if some of our friends want to come down here and stay, they have a place to stay.

I wouldn't be leaving all that much because I enjoy being a home body to going to occasional shows would be nice, maybe a movie here and they're going to eat once in a blue moon once this covid thing is completely over. If it ever is over or else just getting more food shipped in, you know, Door dash works Grubhub works over. Its all work.

So for me, reducing my stress, increases my satisfaction in life in every other possible way. It increases my satisfaction in everyday things like work relationships, but it also helps me enjoy my downtime more. It helps me get more relaxation and rest out of the weekends and vacations, which means I'm even more recharged when I do return to work in everyday life. Um so trying to be more satisfied, really hinges on reducing stress in every aspect of life. That could be work stress, relationship stress, it could be self imposed stress just by letting yourself get angry at small, small things, uncontrollable things, getting mad at traffic, getting mad at other people for things, things you have no control over.

He has a really big spending problem but I've been trying to tell show him our bills and stuff and so he realizes how serious our debt problem is. So he now recently the last few weeks he's been really working on not buying anything. Um our life would be a lot more satisfying when we get out of debt because then my husband can, he's an auto mechanic, he can quit his job, he's been wanting to quit for a while because he's in his mid 40s and his body's wearing out. Um It's hard for him to work in the the hat Nicole and he works two hours away so I don't get to see him that much during the week so if he could quit his job it would really help everything and all we gotta do is pay off some bills and then he can quit. Um And I think that I'll have a satisfying life because that I could spend more time with my kids and my husband we could go on camping trips more when he doesn't work so much. So I think that if we take care of the money problems that will help me have a more satisfying life. And also if I can help my Children in school more um they really like going to school um a lot. Um My son Alex he's doing a lot better in school. he's reading a lot better than he used to be and I guess to have a satisfying life. I just want to encourage my Children to do the best they can in school and their hobbies and I just want to help my husband to relax. Um So he doesn't have to work so much. Um I guess I want all my my friends to be happy and my family. Um I'd like to spend more time with my family, I live in a more real area so it's hard for me to see everybody that I want to see.

I couldn't come to the States and bring her to the States during the pandemic. That was impossible. And we were in France. So that's something that I took care of before I was able to leave France and come back to the United States.

He's in France at the moment for part of the time and then as much time as he can spend here in the United States, he comes. So Anyway, what I've done is I've set the example for my Children by simplifying myself. And I probably eliminated about 98% of my possessions to be able to move from a larger house to an apartment and then to a smaller house on the other side of France. And then finally packed about five boxes of our possessions to send to France plus a collection of art. So we're living right now in a small room with almost all of our possessions around us. And it was a necessary step because I have very little time to take care of things, and I have little space. So for now it's worked out very well.

Because what I do currently now is a quality assurance engineer.

Um Yeah, where I live, there's just not very many people like me, there's not really a lot of queer people, there's not a lot of people who have the same struggles that I do um in terms of disability and things like that and there's not even very many people in my age. Also everybody's either younger or older for whatever reason. Um So there's just not very many people can connect with here, there's not a lot to do here um there's just not a lot of options in general. Um So I mean luckily I'm not a very social person anyway and the work I do um is work from home stuff so that you're really busy and um that's fine where I live, but I just wish that um yeah, I wish I had more money, so I had more options than one option I would definitely take is to move somewhere with a little bit more happening, more interesting people to me um more things to do and things like that, more new experiences I guess sometimes it just feels a little stagnant where I live and the work I do um just offers a certain amount of novelty. Um But yeah, sometimes I just give a little experience hungry in general um but where I'm at, there's not really one concrete step you can take towards that, so I'm just I've been trying to refine my work to um find a better balance of, you know, find things that really work for me long term and that things will burn me out in the long run um And you know, ways I can, you know, leverage these things to actually bring in more money.

But if I were able to get a good job, I think one of my first steps towards a goal of a more satisfying life would be to basically start working on my body again in ways that I feel needs fixing throughout my entire life. I've had a permanent stuffy nose because of a a bone cartilage basically it's just In the wrong spot in my nose and it's nothing bad, but it just means I'm never able to breathe like fully through my nose, it always sounds stuffy basically, even when it's not in the 6th sense. So what I would do definitely is save up towards a surgery and that I'd also probably get liposuction or any type of weight reducing surgery as well. Anything to start working on my body basically. Besides that I would really want to put money into savings instead so that I can find somewhere other than new york city to live in. Because even though this city is really convenient for having basically any and everything you want around you, it is just way too expensive to live in. So ideally moving somewhere if I were going to stay in the States towards the middle or farther north up of the country where ideally things like rent are much cheaper. Um But also I think I would just want to leave the U. S. In general because you know, we're very infamous for extremely unhealthy and processed foods. You basically can't buy anything in a supermarket that isn't like inherently unhealthy. Besides like you know dedicated farmers, market vegetables and whatnot. Um I think being able to live in a country where the food is just much fresher and you don't have to worry about eating basically everything that tastes artificial innately would also be a good step towards a more satisfying life.",193.4,340,105.480868665977,"2022-12-22T01:38:46.831Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-179d6331-9f3b-4faa-b196-c8d3aa64cca6/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=608c75be6bf5ca1f23ab35ad&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3ae4d6631959bc7e593ef","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",7,"No"

I would also make a vision board. I think having a visual representation of the goals that we want to meet are very important and are things that we can easily do to constantly feel inspired and to feel motivated to reach those goals. A couple other steps I would take is actively talk about those goals. I think that other people around me should be aware of my goals and the things that I want to achieve, and I think that if other people can get on board, they can be supportive about those goals or they can even help me achieve those goals by reminding me to stay on task or even finding resources that can be helpful for me overall.

I've always looked around, I would, I would really like to be able to exercise. I know that would boost the endorphins and dopamine and everything and probably um lighten my mood up a little bit more. I'm not giving up. Um I just have like seven or 8 doctors and you know, a lot of different issues here and there and just hoping for the best. That's really all I can do, try to eat, eat good, but I can't do fruits and veggies, I can't do fiber, any kind of carbs, I can do that, but just trying to stay positive. I'm going through a lot right now, but I'm trying to stay positive and just not give hope and give up hope. I don't wanna be a grumpy old lady and be sick at home and out of shape.

So he told me to basically just let the cataracts going so I can barely see. Um So at that point the surgery doesn't work. I wouldn't have lost much but at that point I'm not gonna be able to do a lot of these things I do like to prolific things in the app from work and stuff like that too.

I would know that there was still an income coming in that would make for more satisfying life because that's my one thing I'm concerned about is what's going to happen in the future when I can no longer keep this stuff going. Um So that would be my first goal is to find a way to uh spending more time like on a regular basis, uploading, creating more projects and uploading them to the storage so that there's more I have them.

So if I'm gonna say I want to make my game, well maybe today I need to work on a couple of monsters for the game. So I'll even break that down, like maybe I can work on a few pieces of their kit and design them out a little bit and then um anything more than that will be extra. So I'll have like future goals. Um so ultimately I tried to figure out, but would make my life more satisfying and then break it down into goals and then make those actually obtainable and ask myself constantly, like what will make me happy and work towards those things that make me happy but make it realistic and reachable. Um so right now that's what I'm doing. I'm working, I'm doing, working on my programming, working on my game stuff, doing work stuff, doing my errands, and just generally moving towards a more satisfying life, even though I'm pretty satisfied and content with where I'm going right now and where I'm at.",98.41,354,215.83172441825,"2022-12-22T05:17:47.233Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-50017d25-ddc6-4a6d-833c-69690e8e354b/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5d91daf3704e790018f47229&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a3e44f0b509654c039f62c","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",34,"No"

Like, like satisfying when I think a lot, I think of being able to do the things I want to do, being able to knock some things off the bucket list as a kid, right? Like for a very long time I dream was going into political political theory, not politics. I dread politics, but political theory theory is something I find very fascinating. In the first year of undergrad, I took this class about power and justice and I learned about certain dynamics of power. Like Michel Foucault's idea of Chopticon and I was just very driven by this philosophical niche that I was like, hey, I could read about this forever. I have really bad attention disorders and this was the one thing I just kept reading about. Like it's something I remember until now it's the one class. Remember anything from undergrad beyond even the classes that relate to my work now, I barely remember anything blows. But I remember reading Michelle from coast Works, I'm just becoming fascinated with them and I knew it was like, I want to study this field, but unfortunately I, I went to a stem field and while I'm possibly doing better in terms of like finances than I would, if I had went to political theory right? I don't, it just feels like everything I work for isn't something I want. So I guess in order for me to make my life more satisfying, it would have to be a pursuit of hedonism because I like, I want to, on one hand, it's like, yeah, maybe being altruistic and helping other people would bring bring me satisfaction, right? But the core of it, it's because I'm satisfied by these things and not satisfaction equates to happiness. Which is kind of a pursuit of hedonism. But generally yeah, like dedicate my life to like like the study of political theory. I want to go for a masters and PhD and that I would want to I have my attainable dream cars so I could, you know, go fast and here be loud. I want to have a cat in my little little apartment and I wanna spend my spare time volunteering. And that is what I would think is satisfying.

Like for me it would be getting out, meeting people who getting, you know, may be involved in a romantic relationship and just having a more of a social life. And so what I would need to do is make a plan or come up with the steps that I need to do in order to fulfill that. The the problem is that even though it sounds simple, I don't handle social situations very well and I'm sort of limited financially and I live in a very rural area. So even if I wanted to go out and meet people, I don't really have the money to, and there's really nowhere to go to meet like minded people around here, but I would need to come up with a realistic way of actually achieving these goals or coming or listing all the prerequisites I need to have in place before I can go forward and start that and then start knocking those prerequisites out. So if I feel like money is a factor for me being, not being to go out and date or anything like that. And obviously I need to find a way to make more money. Well, don't we all, it's just uh, I don't know, coming up with the plan, it's easy, it's, you know, actually carrying out the plan. That's hard. Another thing besides romance and social stuff is uh just finding more of a purpose in my life. I always wondered what I should do if I should continue my education or what if I had a choice for any job? What would I get? And I haven't really been able to answer that. So I should maybe just rethink about what is most important to me right now as I am, and then try and set out and uh like I said, make a list and fill out the prerequisites for that and just try and make all get all the building blocks together that will enable me to go out and try to make us more satisfying life for myself.",165.42,392,142.183532825535,"2022-12-22T05:46:41.738Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-f9ea22a2-82da-4e05-8c27-1bbb7095bb1e/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",15,"No"

If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal? Well believe it or not, I made my first step towards this goal last night, I I earlier I had mentioned about having to say goodbye to my my dog, She would have been 19 in January, it has been one of the um hardest things in my life saying goodbye to my, my baby girl and so I helped her across the bridge, September 16 of this year and like I said, it's it's been very, very depressing for me and so we just, we just passed 90 days and I am trying so hard to stop thinking about, It's 90 days that she hasn't been with me and I'm trying to turn it around and Celebrate that that was 90 days that she has not been suffering. So um getting to the good, the good part, because that is the sad part, I did have to let my dog go and it has been so sad for me, but also knowing that I did made the best decision that I could make and that she is no longer suffering. So I started looking on Petfinder and actually I have been looking just because just to see animals gives me that little tiny bit of joy, you know, um it helps to boost the endorphins, right? So that's what I have been using it for up till now because well not that I'll ever be able to replace her because I can't just like, she didn't replace the dog that was before her. They each have just made that space in that room in the home and the need for me to go out and adopt another pet Because each of my dogs that I've had in the last 30 years were the only pets in the home. So they were, they had me all to themselves, you know, I spoiled them to death and um it's so hard to lose a pet there. They're such an important part of our lives for those of us who are pet lovers and have pets. Um, but I did find, I did find a dog a couple of days ago at my local humane society and I feel like she's leading me two, my next little next little baby because I know she's still with me and our connection can never be broken. She comes to me in my dreams, she comes to me online, she comes to me just me sitting here and in fact when I found that little dog, I don't know why I have my, my, my table decorated for christmas with a little christmas tree and pictures of her from when I took her to visit santa at um at the Bass Pro shops. That was so much fun and they're such great pictures and I have this set up with candles and her podcast and I was videotaping, I don't know why I videotaped the table that day before I laid down to go in to go to sleep, but I was videotaping the table in front of the tree and I asked my echo dot if we were expecting snow this week, which she told me we were now we are, we're under under a blizzard warning. But as I was videotaping this, an orb came from her picture. You can see this in the video. I didn't know I didn't see it until I played played the video back and this little orb flew from her picture up over the candles. To me. It was my sign. And so yes, I have taken that step. I filled out an application for this dog and I'm waiting to hear back.

However, society makes it very hard because everything in life requires money, not happiness or at the end of the day, I uh the things that make me sort of I guess okay with content at the moment don't have money, but more satisfying.

But even then if there's all these other issues, which I was prepared to work out and you know, I still am, which, you know, issues transportation then how to and from your job, I studied the public bus, just the public bus routes here where I, I guess, and uh, was even practice like ran them going to these different jobs that I was applying for, but I never got that far, but now the location event is very, very, very rural, um, out in the country you could say. And so transportation from there into the nearest city, which is where the majority of these jobs are, that's a little more difficult and challenging and I don't know, it's very, it's very hard I guess, maybe I'm so in other words, I'm looking for, not alternatives to uh, this that step, you know, alternatives to a job and, but I am uh, you know, thankfully, uh thankfully and lucky and luckily enough in a place where I can like living living situation wise where I can simply exist and with things happen with all this stuff that's happening in my life right now, I think that's what I need. Um, and I'm not being pressured to do any of this. However, I still know that I need to, it's in the back of my mind, trust me, I have one particular individual in my life who I know will smack smack some sense into me if I ever get to the point where I'm not I'm not doing what I need to be doing and I'm just no longer just simply existing, but kind of like wasting my existence on doing nothing, if that makes sense.

That's just plain simple. If I can bring them both down from one is now, um, one went from being a felony to a misdemeanor, but that's the good news. But the other one is not, let's just be plain and simple here. If I brought it down all the way to the originals, to the, to a misdemeanor as well, both of them could be squashed and I would no longer have to deal with all the problems that came with it on the verses in my life.

I should be saying that decent money, Okay money. And when it tops out, it'll be okay. It'll be decent money. But the problem is as far as ever shaking the dust of this old town, probably not. I'll probably have to do with my work hybrid. But you know what? At the very least at least it's better than making nothing. I'll probably be taking over my family's businesses.

Try to build an empire that can be left to my family, my kids once I'm gone because I believe they will need it. Especially with my son. I don't want him to have to be uh in a nursing home where he really can't do anything and experience life. I want him to be able to experience life. Um even if it means having somebody to care, take for him and things like that and him live in his own house or in a group home or something. I want a good one. And around here where I live, there is absolutely nothing. We don't even have mental health care. So my goal um is to be financially secure and uh to move away from the area that I'm in. I want to as far as having a satisfying life, I would like to open up a bookstore that has more than just books. Um I wanted to be like more of a both new and used bookstore, but also as well as rare oddities antiques because to me a lot of people have gone away from libraries since you go online, you know and read and well I don't mind that I like to have a real book in my hands and I think having real books um brings communities together because then you can do, like I opened a bookstore, I want to do something like uh have an event that was focused around books on gardening or a specific book that was being promoted and then inviting the public, especially Children that don't know anything about gardening or people that don't know anything about gardening. Uh inviting them to an event where they would be able to uh be able to grow their own herbs, you know? Um something like that, so they could have that experience, understand you know things um not just gardening but you know music wise um uh would focus on having, you know, local artists play um you know at the bookstore and things like that because I would be promoting whatever if that local artists had a book out maybe or you know, specific type of music they played, you know, things like that. Um I also want to move to a warmer climate. I'm thinking the island's kind of like Richard Branson, that's my goal was to be another richard Branson to be honest. Um because it's just too cold where I'm at, we're about to hit a negative 22 degrees. Um We already have the wind chill factor down, the winds are 45 miles an hour. Um I guess I could tell you why I'm from Kansas and if you've kept an eye on the weather there wherever you're at. Um you probably know we're smack in the middle of this bad weather storm that we're getting ready to have this arctic chill and I have arthritis. Um it's one of my health problems. It does not help me whatsoever. I am freezing even with electric fireplace and you know, we have central heat and air here. I'm still in pajamas, to be honest, um I am in a house coat because it's 4 35 I'm sorry, it is not 4 30 in the morning, It's honestly 6:25 AM. Um so you know, it's cold. Um put it that way um we haven't hit that negative 22 yet, but it's coming where it experiencing snow and all of that. So my goal is to be in a warmer climate um as well because um I can't stand the cold, the cold is too much on my arthritis anymore. I freeze all of the time, my feet go now, my hands go numb. I know a lot of it is I need more nutritional vitamins in my body and stuff and I need to take care of myself a lot more, even though I am doing natural.

And my house and property, takes so much time. And unfortunately, my girlfriend, who I'm with, who I'm with whom I'm going to have to have a serious, frank discussion, um, takes a whole lot of time as well. And I don't think I'm in a position where I can be a good boyfriend, and I really think the first step towards my goal of a more satisfying life in order to provide myself with more time is to either sever my relationship, my romantic relationship or future relationships, for that matter, in order to make time, especially for music, there's really nothing in the world, not even sex anymore. That is as gratifying or mentally reinforcing as as making music and, um and maybe I just need to find somebody who understands what being a musician is like I mean, I did warn her. I'm not sure she listened. There's a reason people say, Don't date a musician it's a good it's good advice. Don't date a musician. But if if you're a musician, then you'll get it. So maybe you should, you know you can date musicians, so maybe that's my goal. That's the first step is to either break up with my girlfriend or fundamentally rearrange our relationship so that I can make more time. And it's not really just for making music, either. It's for fixing up my house and getting my financial situation in order. I mean, if I'm not, if I'm not good enough to be a the boyfriend she needs, then she needs to find somebody who's the right fit for anyway. Um, yes, making time, That's what I need to do.

So I think getting my health in order would be the first step because then everything else would kind of follow. So I think getting the inflammation in my body, down and getting on the right set of psychiatric meds and working out kind of everything kind of would work together, I guess, because working out and eating healthy and sleeping right with all help with the inflammation in my body and the inflammation and my body is at least in part connected to some of the other problems I have like depression. So I think in order to have a more satisfying life, I need to actually want to be enjoying life and feeling better. So I would focus first on taking logical steps to making myself feel better and then I could examine once I'm feeling better, my energy levels were up, I could take a look at what the steps would be from there to move forward with the rest of my life.

So I was thinking about maybe doing that and just focusing on that in my life and and yeah, that would be probably my first step is just doesn't matter what it is, don't need not be a good story, I'm not necessarily trying to get it published, but to just sit down and start doing it.

So while I live in a three bedroom home, only one bedroom is actually able to have somebody sleep in it while the other two are functioning merely storage units for all the things from my mother's apartment as well as things that I have accumulated christmas, decorations and the whatnot that goes with life. Uh I've tried multiple times to go through my mother's things sometimes with success, but usually not usually I become lost in memories and I also have her memories. So I'll have, I have a set of pictures that are of people in places I don't even know and I find myself unable to part with them. I did have um all the pictures that we knew of digitized. I had a bunch of, of photos redone and restored by a local person who is is um known Countrywide for doing that kind of work. So I have some of these memories captured, but I still find it difficult to let go of it, which I guess is an aspect of my personality. It's not such an appealing part. Um I would like very much to live in an Uncluttered space. I know what I need to do to get there. The motivation to do. It gets drowned out by the emotional impact of having it happen. So it's um it's still kind of a catch 22. I keep thinking to myself that as my mother's death recedes in time, it will get easier so far that has not happened. But one of the things that most worries me is that unlike my mother who had multiple Children to come in and help and sort and make decisions, I have one child and um, the idea of leaving her with a disaster should something happen to me crosses my mind and it is not something I want her to have to go through.

Um but I do know the answer to this because it's something that I've been thinking about because my life just feels empty. Um I have my job, it's not my passion. I keep lamenting about the fact that I will never make it through medical school um Because they require too freaking much out of you and I'm neurodivergent and so depressed and I know that 80 plus hours a week would kill me. So that's extremely disappointing. But um I have found a foot in I think well yeah, I would love to go back to school to become a pathologist assistant because that that gets me into pathology without the medical school and that's like exactly what I need. Like yeah, I might not be the one making the big grand decisions, but I would still be involved in the process and I just think diseases fascinating, fascinating. I love learning about the human body. It's, I've been passionately learning about it since I was a kid, right? It was a very, very sad day um when I realized I would never survive medical school. So my first step now is probably to either make more money now so I can save up for it or um well I'm looking into the application and that's probably going to be the first steps is trying to do that and then trying to get the financial aid that I need, which good luck. Um Yeah, I'm already, the thing is though I'm so far in debt that I'm afraid to take more on and I'm pretty nervous that you know, if I did this thing would I ever be paying off 100 grand or whatever I would have for going back to school?

So for me, I feel like a first step towards a more satisfying life is really having a career that you actually love because I know a lot of people work jobs. They don't really love just to have food on the table. But I've seen other people give ted talks or like other people that actually generally love their job and like it is very different, like you can see it from the expression on their face and how passionate they are about their job and makes me believe that once you find that it will be so much better because you won't feel like you're really going to work as much more like you're just like enjoying your time and while making good money as Well. So I feel like if I was able to find that that would make me much more satisfying, especially if it's a job that's more flexible and something that where I could work for myself instead of working for an employer because my 9-5 isn't really degrade, especially since I think that it's a little bit too constricted and I like working in my own hours more since I'm not really a morning person. So I feel like if I could figure out which kind of career path I could possibly shift two and a career path, I know that will make decent money, so I could sustain, it will be great and I know it's difficult, but like at least maybe I could just try it a little at a time, so that is one of my goals for next year to explore other career paths.",118.37,369,187.040635296105,"2022-12-22T15:10:43.693Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-82903e45-27bc-4fab-8d7d-c0b4f313b9bd/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5f919a881f37510203a7a638&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a46e0e128a6ac6c839748f","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",19,"DATA_EXPIRED"

Um, I need therapy badly, but part of my trauma and my issues and my mental health is wrapped up with every horrible medical experience that me or my family members have experienced the last two decades. Yes, So I need the tools to learn to emotionally regulate. But I can't get access to the tools because I cannot emotionally regulate. But that's not the question. The question is the first stop. I don't know what the first step would be because I feel like I the first step, I have to break things into the smallest steps because what seemed like what might seem like one step for one person might be actually like five steps for me. It's like, Oh, how do you do the laundry? Oh, you take the laundry down to the washer. You put the laundry in the washer, you put the detergent in the washer and you wash your clothes and you take it out and you put it in the dry. No, it's gather all your clothes, make sure they're on the hamper and make sure that you've got all your dirty clothes. You take the hamper. You put it down, you got to organise all your clothes. So, like the lights with the lights and darks with the dark, Some things can't be in hot water. Some things can't be in cold water. And I was like, I have to think through all of that. So technically, the first step for like, a person who is like you're a typical would be Oh, just get on the phone. Scheduled doctor's appointment for the freaking therapy. No, no, no, no. I gotta hype myself up. I hate phone calls. So first of all, I have to find the confidence to make that phone call I have to do to make that phone call the scheduled appointment. And then they're all the steps to get into the after scheduling the appointment. Obviously, because there's so much talking, it's like, Oh, I have to go. So I need general checkup, but also need I want to get screened for a d. H. Huh? But all the steps that involve getting ready to go to the appointment and all the fighting that I'm gonna have to do, because are you sure it's not a d H D? it's probably just depression or oh, you're very outspoken in very contradicting. Maybe you have What the hell is opposite opposition? Oppositional defiance disorder? But I guess the first step is definitely something to there's so many first steps that I could take. But I guess one of the first step, it's something so I can manage this chaotic brain of mine something to be a little bit more caring to myself, to be a little bit more gracious to myself. Anything if whether that's going online, learning self therapy, learning more like, uh, something like that, something like that, because I need to be nicer to myself. And the first step lies in with me being nicer to myself, being more gracious and understanding with myself and me finding the energy and all that sounds like wrapped up in talking to a freaking medical professional professional, because I know there are things that are wrong. That was just my mind, but my body and I need help, so that would probably have to be the first step. But, you know, I've been trying for the last two years and we'll see how it goes. Hopefully somebody will help me If I can't help myself, I hope somebody because I keep dropping hints that I need somebody to help me with this. But nobody's taking into it because I struggle so much for asking for help, and I don't think and honestly, it's like, Oh, I can I need somebody to call for me. I can't be the one who calls So I don't think people understand that. I know like there's legal troubles with that sometimes, but like I can't I can't do it. I cannot. I cannot schedule my own appointment. There's just too much emotions when I'm on the phone trying to do that. It's just too much. I cannot do it.

We have all the basic needs that we want, any food, anything, any basics we need, we can just get, we're very content and very comfortable, warm, uncomfortable, safe. Um it's actually a very safe house to the previous owner had bars put on the windows and they are the kind that you can quick release from the inside. But anyway, it's a very safe, quiet place to live. So a more satisfying life. There are some things that I would like, maybe a little bigger house, um some additional workout facilities that I can't have here because of space, a swimming pool, and indoor swimming pool. I think that those things are probably money, things, big money, bigger money than we've got now. It would require another plateau. So I think the first step towards that goal would be to either go back to work for a full time job, or really buckle down on finding some ways to work from home and earn money from home. Either creative ways from writing, publishing, editing, or online tasks here. I'm doing a survey that's getting me a little bit of extra money, but I think that I'd have to take some steps toward making substantially more money incoming than I have now",107.95,264,146.734599351552,"2022-12-22T15:19:45.189Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-89ffee39-3520-413f-a479-9398acd35a21/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5ec44da606cb7931f04a35e9&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a4705e47698272626fa00b","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",31,"No"

So pretty much my first step towards that goal right now is saving the money to buy the trailer because I don't have a horse trailer right now. Um Actually the first step pretty much would be fixing the rig that I'm in now, as I said, I've been full timing in it now and it's been like 2.5 years. We've been full timing in this particular rig and well, you know, boys are rough, so I've got a few little spots that I need to fix in here and get this place ready to sell.

Um So I definitely, you know there is room to raise my rates which I'm actually doing. Um And starting in january, I have a new rate that new customers have to pay my existing customers um receive the old rate as long as they're continuously enrolled in lessons. But if they leave the and then come back they're subject to the new rate. So I'm raising my rates which is hopefully going to bring in more income next year. Um Also as part of that I would have to diversify my uh like basically my offerings like as a voice lesson studio which I'm actually doing this next year. I have like a membership program that is, you know, lower cost than private lessons, but it's another way to kind of add extra income without the without spending spending too much time on it. The membership program definitely doesn't take up as much of my time as like one on one lessons too.

If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would your first step step towards that goal?

And that would be trying to live a more moral and ethical life in line with the doctrines of my God and the Holy scriptures. So that is my current goal, and that is the way to give me a more satisfying life. Now, if I were to expand on that from a earthly and human standpoint and not looking towards the future heaven or anything of that nature, what would give me a more satisfying life would probably be to know where I would be in the near future. In other words, I would like to feel comfortable, comfortable knowing that if I cannot care for myself and I cannot, if something were to happen, I would like to have peace in knowing where I could be in the interim, before death.

Well, I'm a philosopher at heart. So honestly they wouldn't be and mechanical and material things that I'd be shooting for. Its inner behavior that needs to change in a discipline that needs to change. Um, and I don't quite know what that looks like in the short view, In the long view, it looks like being able to take things in stride when they don't work out. Being able to handle other people's attitudes and prejudices. A more satisfying life to me isn't glamorous. It's a life where I can be consistently happy. You know, everyone has bad days, I get that and I'm fine with a few bad days. But lately my behavior and my mental state, um, my tastes are far worse than good and that hurts because I used to be so much more optimistic. I feel like I used to be a completely different person in essence, I guess I was, but for a more satisfying life for me, yeah, I would just like to be more consistently happy and what that looks like right now, I guess. I don't know, I'm doing a little bit of work that I need to do, putting in apps, going to college, you're not registered for classes and all that. So hopefully all this leads to a more satisfying life a life where I feel like I have a little more control, I suppose. Yeah, get a vehicle, start driving, get out of here, you know, have more freedom. We want to put that like I wouldn't be necessarily stuck. Um you know, my connections would increase. I'd be able to go farther, talk to more people, connect to more people. That's what progress looks like to me and have a more satisfying life. I was very satisfied, You know, 3, 4, 5 years ago, but very content. Um, now I want to be able to reach people and home people and love people and try to help heal this broken world. So any small step that brings me closer to that is good. I would say again mostly comes down to discipline, more self discipline, more love and care for myself and understanding for others when I don't like the way they're behaving or acting.

Um, but, and uh, actually some people do go and walk around the block and stuff just to get some exercise and walk that I don't do it. Um, I guess because I've lived in nicer places to walk for a short time. I lived in judo and I was fortunate enough to live in a place where I could go and walk up a hill on the island. But now here in El paso where we live, it's city is urban. It's actually, I took a look before we even left Oaxaca. I studied this place so much on google maps and I know how industrial it is. Mm hmm. Uh yeah, it's not the nice and well, no, it's not terribly ugly. Like I said before, what the thing is, the thing is, is now is that it's too cold. See, they're too cold. It's too hot. I guess we'll see how spring is here. We've been here a year, but I can't remember. But it's also not the area. I don't think that you just walk around one thing that I don't like about the States. I think compared to other places like, I don't know, so much, so much europe or Asia or I'm just, I do not know. No. Um just in comparison it's okay to walk in other places, but I don't know, I haven't been in texas that long either. Gosh is you should have to always be in a car. I remember when I used to drive in California before, yeah, before I left for Japan, I used to like it. I'm blessed, I was fortunate enough to be able to drive a lot, but I don't, in terms of the environment, I don't even want a car now. Mhm. I don't know.

I would be taking care of my mental and emotional health as well. And probably the emotional and mental health of my Children as like, put that down, don't eat non kidding, they don't do that well, my daughter does that, but so, um yeah, so I think that if I felt better, because, you know, some days I feel fine, fine ish and then other days I feel like absolute garbage and I would probably be willing to bet that a lot of the aches and pains and fatigue I have are a result of not exercising and um not being, you know Careful with my diet, I swear to God, some days I still eat like I ate when I was 15 and the other days I'm like, oh, I can't eat that, but I need to do that. Oh my gosh, I can't eat that more way more. Um yeah, so I think that if that was my goal, um because I have a treadmill that my daughter got me and I use it occasionally, but I should use it every day and I have a rowing machine that my son got me that I use, almost never should move that downstairs upstairs. Um so yeah, those would be the first step. So I would just get on the treadmill every day for like, start a half an hour and then work my way up to an hour day of exercise. And I think that would probably make a dramatic change in how satisfying my life was, because if I felt that physically and I would feel better mentally and I would be more probably energetic so that I could get out of the house more and do more fun stuff.

Well, funny you should ask because we're kind of going through this right now. So um I have decided I'm 58 years old. So I've decided I don't want to be one of these guys that work still 70 and 75, you're, you're dead, you know, I want to enjoy life and my wife feels the same way. So um we're making a whole life shift to have a more satisfying life. We are downsizing, we're getting rid of the big house were, we bought some land on a lake nearby, we're putting a couple of tiny houses on it to generate income. You use them as Airbnb s were simultaneously building a log cabin that's about halfway done, the logs are up Um still have to do the plumbing and all the interior build out, but we're making progress on that and um quitting the corporate thing that I've been doing for nearly 40 years and same for her and um we also own several RVS and we want to pursue that passion even more, and our our goal would be to travel about half the time. Um six months out of the year. We also bought a lot in Arizona that we can call our home base when we're out west because we're out in Georgia and so we want to travel and see the country and you know, I've only seen this country from the inside of an airplane in a conference room for most of my career, I really want to get out there and you know, spend some time at the Grand Canyon, Yosemite um and 100 other places um you know moab and you know Sedona and all these other places that, you know, I've driven through or flew over but you know, never spent any time there. So my goal is to um you know, to reach that, get a little more satisfaction in life, you only live once. And um so we're actually taking action to make that goal a reality. And uh it's been kind of a slow process is, you know, it's been going on for a couple of years that we've kind of put this plan together, but I think within the next six months we'll put our main house on the market. I mean we're empty nesters who needs a six bedroom, five bath house. We certainly don't with our families that do we get rid of this? We have the cabin, we have the property out in. Arizona are rvs, we have a couple of tiny houses to help generate income. We have our retirement. I think that will lead to a much nicer, less stressful life at least that's our plan. We'll see how that works out. You know what they say, life is what happens when you were making plans. So All right, that's it.

But even if I had time off, I don't know what I would do with it. I think traveling is fun, but I don't think there's a really good end goal there, It doesn't really build on my life here at home. So I know that recently I've started trying to build up my local friends group because I realized when Covid happened that most of my friends were far away. And so it was very, it was very hard because I found out that despite the fact that I thought I had 2025 friends, nobody really kept in touch once we couldn't see each other frequently. So I focused on creating spaces locally where I could meet people. I started a board game day that lots of people come to and I think that's a good first step. I wish it would grow a little faster. Um I think creating spaces is one of my big goals because it's hard to meet people and I know I'm not the only person who thinks so, so if I create these spaces, not only will I get to meet people, but maybe other people will also get to meet other people and feel less isolated",94.88,265,167.580101180438,"2022-12-22T16:02:07.655Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-5515a883-c491-4dd2-938e-d62b45f3acf1/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=60a56378aa5f55ddac516adc&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a47b08f1659d5b33c91dba","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",18,"No"

Unfortunately humans have kind of put themselves into that that that bundle that hard, you know, you gotta have money to do this and that, I think money is so on human, you know, I mean for millions and millions of years of evolution, we were hunters and gatherers.

That's the, you know, that's basically what it all boils down to is, you know, so I think money is, you know, they always say the money is the root of all evil, it kind of really is, you know, if you look at civilizations before that, yeah, we had civilizations, you know, competing against each other just for hunting and farming area. Um you know, early cultivation, uh you know, that established the very first societies, you know, sometimes they would go at war with each other just for resources, but I think the most satisfying, you know, way of living life is just to not have, you know, any of those any any worries about, you know, where we're getting food from and we're at a place right now where we're technical logically advanced enough that we could easily, you know, gear ourselves to a way of living where, you know, money isn't an issue.

And uh and I think that's the best way of having a satisfying life, is not having any worries. No, no worries.

Um I guess this is another question where it sort of depends what are the parameters, what rules do I have, Right?

If if you know that you don't have to worry about where the mortgage payments coming from, or where the roof over your head or the food is coming from, uh give so much freedom and and generally I have that, but um it's I don't have so much freedom that that I can stuck on work, right? Um So if we live, if we're constrained to the current sort of environment, I'd say the first step toward that goal would be saving money, right? Um uh So that you're at a point where at some point it's just not something that you have to be concerned about. If instead it's a more sort of esoteric freeform. You know, if you were creating creating more satisfying life and more satisfying world, the first f. B. I think it would be more free time.

So I need to get in better physical shape. I'm not getting any younger, I just turned 45 years old. You know, I'm losing weight, but I also need to be active. Like that's, I used to be super super active and then the first year Covid was perfectly fine. Second year Covid, it was very difficult for me. Um, and it, and it goes a lot to some of the things I mentioned earlier, where I want to have the freedom to choose what I decide to do with my own personal self. And so, um, I chose even, you know, it's interesting. I have quite a few family members that work in science and pharma and medicine and, and um, where I was in terms of my comorbidities and my health, it didn't really make sense for the label indications of the vaccines to take them because I made a choice not to. And my employer respected that choice, but yet I had so many people around me that were personal that just expressed utter hatred and vileness. And so, um, that second year when kind of even the White House was saying things and people were just really horrifically cruel and nasty. Um, it, I just got out of the practice of working out. I realized I hit like this depression that I didn't even realize was depression. So I want to get back to that to get to where, you know, I feel physically good, um, or physically active and feel good about being physically good. I think that would be more satisfying. I had more energy. Um I think two is really balanced and I mentioned earlier one of my recordings how much I love my work and for years, even before I had a partner work was all there was besides friends and family, which is still very different than than having like a partner. Um and so work was kind of like, I would say my quasi passion and one thing that I've noticed and even my, my employer, my my management said, you know, I had the distinction of taking the least amount of vacation out of any employee last year and they were like, that's not good. And my partner had been saying that for a while and I I guess I didn't really realize what I was doing and so I'd like to just kind of have a little bit more balance and so that's one thing I'm working on this year, I've already scheduled two vacations, um but I need to really, Really kind of focus on kind of physical, making sure I do at least 3-4 workouts a week just to feel good in my physical body and also um really kind of bifurcating work and personal life too and trying to get more balance there",175.59,499,170.510849137195,"2022-12-22T16:35:54.234Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-2aa9b32c-4656-4bec-8063-5bce807b0931/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5c54bf7d77f9e700015ef638&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a481e16ad19a6762678364","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",25,"No"

So I look at how life is going now and decide, you know what's going well, what isn't, how could I make it better? Um Because right now I don't necessarily, I don't look at a lot of parts of my life and think, you know this is bad, that's bad, I really need to change this. I mean I know there are things I certainly don't think my my life is perfect or ideal in every single way, but I'm not I'm not also keeping track of all the things that need to be improved. Um So if I wanted to just you know, make my life more satisfying. The first thing I do is again reflect on my life and decide what things can I improve on what things are good for my life and what things aren't. Um Once I've done that and sort of identified the things um that I can change, that I want to change or that might be good to change. Um I would then sort of you know make a plan. Um So so I think maybe I'm thinking alright I spend too much time staring at my phone um You know that that takes away from the other things I enjoy doing in life I'm gonna set a schedule so that I I put my phone away um for the first hour every morning, you know, so if I get up at seven, I'm not gonna look at my phone until eight o'clock and I'm going to start my day without looking at my phone. Um You know so I'd make sort of stuff like that, I sort of create rules um you know our systems um that I can implement into my life to make it more satisfying to make it better. Um Because if I just sort of just generally do stuff I'll just look at my phone less, I won't actually do that, I'll or I'll fall away again.

We could do this for less.

Um But yeah, family would be the number one, I would say that would make my life a little more satisfying um financially were stable, so I know a lot of people probably say finances, but I would definitely be family getting out and seeing all more, making more memories.

So I would probably break that question down a little bit into maybe buckets. Um maybe an idea of how are you doing health wise fits claim mentally. Um how are you doing in terms of how you occupy yourself? And that includes leisure. Are you getting enough time to take care of yourself? Mm would be another, I guess the other category I can think of would probably be social, right? You might have a really great work life um or be healthy.

Again, I had lost a lot of weight before having my kids and then with each successive pregnancy there have been three so far I have um I have gained some and then I'm 44, so kind of starting perimenopause issues and you know it's harder to lose weight especially when you feel bad all the time like you often do with perimenopause. So it's been um a little challenging and I have a six or four and a six month old child right now, so I am Always busy. I don't have really the time to focus on my health the way I would like to my husband's busy working on a degree right now and he works long hours and travels for work a lot. So it's life is really busy right now. But the first step toward a more satisfying life before I can enjoy anything else. I need to get my health in order. That is you know, 100% my number one goal. We're in the process of closing on selling our house now. And as soon as we get to a new place, I am going to really refocus on that. Um Keep busy decorating our house our new house when we get one and just you know, I need the energy to be able to do things. I have little Children and to feel like I'm an effective mother. I really need to lose the weight that I gained from the pregnancies. Again, stay focused on my diet, find time to exercise, also have a condition pots postural Ortho static cardio syndrome. So it's a condition that makes physical activity a lot harder. But ironically enough, doing physical activity, like walking on a treadmill every day actually builds my body up and allows me to get some degree of remission of those symptoms. So it's ironic because the one thing that's really hard to do is the one thing that I need to do to improve the situation. So um so I need to focus on losing the weight and getting my pots back under control and focusing on my diet and exercise especially.

Well my first step would be quite something would be to finish the app ideas that I've been I've had that I put on hold for a long time and launch them. And if they're successful I could then open my own company and go from on from there and expand and grow and just keep ah really profits you could say. But Yeah that would be it, it's quite simple. So it would be hard for me to talk about 90 seconds on the 1st 1st. I would just be the finish apps that I've been putting on hold. Uh what I talk about them. No, I'd rather not talk about. I mean I can give you I guess you could say what they are. One is like a dating app because I feel like I feel tender. The fact that tender is still the top contending dating app for the longest time. I I feel it's ridiculous that that's what we have to work with something superficial and I want something that can dethrone tender from its throne. Another act would be a language exchange app that's not based within china that's based within the U. S. Um It would be targeting Japan but we can make it where it's a global thing. And so that would be a good idea so that there would be competiting language exchange apps or things like that. Language learning app, not just learning but also exchange and the other is just entertainment apps like games that I always wanted to made apps that I always wanted to make, video games, indie games, computer games, all these kind of games and yeah, this would be my first step towards reaching a more satisfying life. The irony of it is my, my angle or ranking. I know it's not part of the question is I just want to live on a small to medium size farm on a tropical land somewhere in the world where I can grow all the dragon fruits that I want to eat and maybe avocado just live a simple life, a simple self sustaining life with green energy, maybe solar panels.

So since that would bring us the most satisfaction at this point, I think the first step towards that goal would be to sit down and actually write out our expenses and figure out what is leaving our bank account each month, what we're spending on things where we can cut that spending and what we need to bring in to move us past this situation we're in right now where we're behind on things and it's a struggle and a constant worry and it just raises our anxiety levels and makes us feel like we're not getting ahead and that things are very difficult.

I feel pretty satisfied with my life as it is, but if I were to have that goal or I were to be talking to someone else who had that goal and providing guidance on that, the first thing to do is to examine um what is in your life, That is not satisfying. And there's an old adage that says, if you don't like your situation change it. If you can't change it, leave it, if you can't leave it, shut up about it. So that's often the way that I approach things that are unsatisfying. Do I have the power to change this? What will it take for me to change this? Uh If I can't change the situation, can I leave it? Can I walk away from the situation? And if I can't, then I just, you know, not necessarily shut up about it. I still talk about it with people who are around me, how it may be frustrating, but basically, I just, it comes to a point of accepting that it can't be changed, it can't be left. And so it either has to be dealt with or ignored And not made the focal point of your of your day. So in general, I think, examining what's dissatisfying and the first step is making one small change, you can't make a sweeping change of everything all in one day, but you can say if I'm not happy about my weight, for example, today is the day I exercise.

Um And I guess as those things materialize um writing them down and um exploring them further as far as um why do I think these things are satisfying to me and namely and like was there an experience that I had where um that detail alone was something that created a satisfactory life.

Um that's you know I think people are people are everything and our connections with other people um are super important in our quality of life and you know how we feel about ourselves and even just you know having hope for getting through whatever challenges we're facing. Um Or something like on the flip side I think some something that you know, most people, especially in the United States will go to is um a promotion, you know or like making more money or having more prestigious job and that's one that I definitely still fall into and have been right now in looking for jobs um And I need to really stop and pause and say you know is that a value of mine um Do I need more money? Do I want this extra responsibility or am I believing that this will create a more satisfactory life because you know that's what I've been told to believe.

You got to kind of have a plan for what it is you're looking for, and then you have to create your steps in order to get to that place. And so for me, the first step would always be, you know, what, what does, what does a sad, more satisfying life even mean? Doesn't mean I have just as much money, but work less doesn't mean I travel more, doesn't mean that I get to see my family more. Doesn't get to mean that I, you know, do more things, you know, buy more fun things like what is it that's going to make my life more satisfying. And I think that's the first step always, once we know that then it's really easy to put a game plan together and kind of figure out what are the next steps they are. But that first step is always the hardest. And it's trying to identify that if you say you want a more satisfying life, but you can't identify what's going to make you more feel more satisfaction. I think that's the deeper weapon. And at that point we have to spend a lot more time being introspective, look at ourselves, look inwards and kind of figure out what it is that we need, that's going to make us feel like we're more satisfied with life and get us in the right direction.

Um having an autoimmune condition.

And so because the things that I choose to do are so high stress, I need to make sure that the things um that I don't choose to do on my own, that is not my decision to make, um are as Easy to manage as possible. And unfortunately when I was about 12 years old, my extended family decided, Okay, she's gonna be the matriarch of our family, so we're gonna get her ready and I take pride in that position. I like being the matriarch at 48. Um, but it comes with a lot of unnecessary stress because sometimes my family just kind of wants my attention. They just want to talk about stuff and I have to tell them, uh, you do realize that what you're talking about, it's kind of stressful to me. For example, in my hometown, they've been experiencing some crime and so like my cousins and my sister and they all called me up and they're just like, oh, so and so and so got shot.

And then I would also start expanding my business, which is crocheting right now. I don't spend a lot of time and effort doing it. I do crocheting as more of a hobby and then some of the things I make I sell.

I had to take my spouse into consideration and many times put him before me because that's what we're told to do of putting our spouse before us.

I'm, you know, I'm not hardly even working anymore. So what would be the sense of that? I have a very safe, secure and loving spouse. So that's what I'll continue with.

Um the first step towards this goal, I'm proud to say, I've already taken this first step and for me, with my struggles, it was to issue drugs and alcohol um had to tackle some, some bad habits that I never thought that I would have to, but that was step one for me and believe me it, it took me a long time, you know, half of the battle was really just admitting that these substances were holding me back and knowing that drugs and alcohol just aren't set up to satisfy you long term. It's after that first time drinking alcohol for example, you can never reach that point again, you know, that has diminishing returns. So that was step One, the more complicated thing, you know, maybe a more interesting answer for you guys would be, you know what Step two? And I really, really wish I had a concrete answer to what is Step two, because that's what I'm wrestling with right now. What, what is step 22 maintaining a satisfactory life even? And I think it's, I think it's spiritual actually, I think I think that I'm spiritually dead in some, I think that'd be a good way to describe it. Um, I guess it would just be answering like, why am I here in the first place? For what purpose am I here? So Step two would be answering that question, what am I actually here for? And then I can start working towards that goal because I know that things like substance abuse or even some of the less insidious addictions would be like consumerism, I know I'm not here to just consume products and make money, spend money, make money, spend money that that that's not working, it's never worked. So, but that's what I see a lot of other people doing, so I have a long list of things that don't lead to a more satisfying life, but I'm really soul searching trying to find what will lead me to a more satisfying life.

I'm learning how to break out of old habits and kind of retrain myself to think certain ways and not be so pessimistic and um try to channel the optimistic side of my personality I guess, which is definitely hard and it's easier said than done, but it's been, I've been doing a lot of hard work in therapy and I think in the end it will lead to a significantly more satisfying life.

Um, society is not set up to allow lower class people to have a satisfying life, particularly if you're a lower class person living with any kind of chronic illness or disability. Um I ironically earned too much to qualify for Medicaid in my state and I cannot afford Obama's affordable healthcare. I'm uninsured. I pay out of pocket. One of the reasons I do surveys for money is because I have an expensive health condition that I have to pay for all by myself. Um, so I work a regular job and then I come home and I get on the computer and I do these surveys for hours and hours and hours usually for pennies. It's demoralizing, it's dehumanizing, It's depressing. Just want to take this opportunity to thank you for paying so much. This is the bright point of my day, honestly is getting a survey that pays $10. Um right here at christmas that helps a lot. So thank you. Um for me to have a more satisfying life. The first step, not my first step, but the first step would be to live in a society that pays people equitably for what they do. A society where minimum wage is the minimum amount on which you can live comfortably and afford to have a family, not the minimum they can legally get away with paying you. And I'm I'm a college educated person. I have several degrees, I have two bachelor's degrees and a couple of years of art school under my belt. And because of circumstances beyond my control, um I currently live in a place that I can't put those degrees to use for me physically. I can't stand for eight hours, I can't lift things.

Um He works in sales and he's been doing better than ever, so much so that he's, you know on track for promotion. I just got a raise at my job too, so that's super helpful.

Um I don't have many regrets. I learned at an early age what I wanted to do fly jets. Um The funny thing was I was 10 in Oregon when I saw the Blue angels and decided I needed to fly phantoms. I knew the Navy had phantoms and the Air Force had phantom's, but I've seen the Navy do it. So I figured, well I got to go to the Navy because that's that's where I wanna be The same summer, I decided I was going to be an F4 pilot. My dad took me deep sea fishing and I spent five hours puking and came back from the deep sea fishing trip with no fish in the firm knowledge that I couldn't be in the Navy because I got sick. So that means I went to the Air Force. Um even as a little kid, I started investigating ways to get into pilot training and the Air Force and do well and learned pretty fast that schooling was important. I took all the advanced classes that I could, I even went to college classes for the last two years of my high school because my high school wasn't very, it was a crummy high school. They didn't have a lot of advanced courses. So there was a small college in town that I could take courses in mathematics and that really helped because I got accepted to the Air Force Academy and if I had had the precursor of the classes earlier I would have done well I might not have been through it because there was two years of math required year of chemistry or your physics a year astro dynamics and aerodynamics. A year of electrical engineering had nauseam. So it was highly technical and highly specialized schooling program. He ended up with a B. S. But we worked for it, but Deciding what I wanted to do, going to the place that allowed me to to do that and then getting out and going to pilot training. And I graduated in 1975 just as Vietnam was winding up. So the pilot training classes went from 100 guys class every six weeks to about 25. And if you weren't from the academy you didn't get to go. So that worked out in my favor. It's not something I could anticipate but it was something that was required And then I managed to get the places I wanted to be. I wanted to fly in Europe and England and I wanted to fly off for us. I did that when I was 32. Um Give up on the air force after 15, 14 years and went to the airlines and that was a good decision. Bad decision. I ended up flying a lot of different air planes including the Boeing 747, which was a real thrill. It's a so that's the best airplane Boeing ever made. Um got to be captain. although that's less of a thrill for me because I already made the kind of decisions in the kind of activities and things that I in the Air Force that you would do as a captain. If you're only from the civilian world, you really have to become a captain to really realize your dreams. But I made it to captain and flew with a lot of young guys and people that were fun to fly with and it was fun to impart some knowledge and share some experience.

I mean, I've explained this in the previous answer and but I've done this a I've tried to lose weight a bunch of times and failed, but the first step and what I'm doing right now in the middle of doing right now is to eat better to exercise, to lose weight, to feel more confident in who I am when I present myself to the world and be able to present myself in in a manner that I find is it looks good, whether it be how I dress and how I look in those clothes, because when I have more confidence in myself, I will be able to I am I my estimation, hope is be able to tackle other issues I have, like, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder. But the first step to getting my life together is to feel more confident in myself by losing weight by dressing better, and that will lead me to being to being able to lead a more satisfying life because then I will be able to address all the other issues I have in my life that are are holding me back significantly.",92.39,291,188.981491503409,"2022-12-23T01:23:13.982Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-3870cb3b-44c2-4d21-a042-9c5fd549a478/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=58cbd0a55d42920001414dd3&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a4f3970d7e5151ff47a9d9","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",6,"No"

My current life is satisfying, but I feel like it could be more satisfying if I started doing more things for me instead of for other people because my job is catered towards providing and serving students in need.

I don't know that I'll ever get satisfaction out of this, but career I never got to do what I wanted to do. But yes, yet I did at the same time, you know what I mean? So I went to school and I got a bachelor's degree but I ended up doing clerical work because it paid more and then now I'm pigeonholed into custom service because they've automated a lot of the clerical jobs. So in a way I'm not really doing what I'm wanting to do, but the way I am, I kind of give up on the whole career idea. I wanted to be a jury person for a while. I wanted to be a veterinarian for a while. I tried to train to be a grant writing, I wanted to be a writer. Um I've trained a lot of stuff and I'm trying to change fields and things would fall apart. They were going to train me to be OSHA safety thing, the company got sold and I never got trained on that so I get things come along and I'm interested in it. I try to get people to teach me to drive a forklift and they don't want to take the time to do it, you know on the job, just Over 20 some years or more of working. I've had all these different opportunities and it just fell apart and I would get training on different things and pay for it or free stuff online and it just didn't work out and um in the psychology thing I didn't pursue that I got paid more to be a clerical person than I did to work for the state of Ohio reminding people to take their medicines and I could have a high school diploma and then that, so I wasn't going to do it with the bachelors. It's a matter of principle I guess or whatever you want to say, maybe I was being stupid and I should have took it. I wanted to go back to social work and the graduate people said that I would have to redo my bachelor's and I'm like, no, I'm not and I'm like, why? And there's like this because the theory is so different from psychology. So you know, just stuff fell apart right now. I'm a content creator for a pet cancer wearing a society. I've been doing it for a year, solid year now and every other month they gave me three or four articles to write and I'm getting um, You know, values with that. I am a writer, I self published on Amazon 15 years ago or something like that. And so a lot of books, but you know, I've won an award in my youth for writing um a state of Ohio from the state of Ohio honorary mention um in a contest. So I've got, you know, I've got some training procedural writing. I helped to write a procedural manual for habitat. I did some writing for a company, It wasn't, you know, it was gross writing. It wasn't I wasn't published. So um you know I've got some stuff under my belt. I have some satisfaction with that. I hope one day I can get you know, a 1099 is contact creator when my dad dies and that's where I would like to go. And I think it would be more satisfied with that. I'm an introvert and I don't like all the office drama. It's not that I hate people. It's just I get drained mentally and physically and emotionally from being around too many people for too much. So that's one reason why I would hate customer service. You talk on the phone all day and then you come home and your family wants to talk to you.

It makes you you, it allows you to be less at the mercy of people or someone, but rather to be in a place of position of leadership with the right resources to get things done, things that would satisfy your life. I believe that life satisfaction comes from the amount of impact you make in life of other people and with my experience having worked for different nonprofit organizations and also being a founder of one, I've come to realize that little is done or not even you can't do much without access to finances. You can't do much without the right network, without the right partnership. And if you have the right finances, you're able to achieve much more. You're able to make more life impact here, able to invest in people's life. So my first step towards achieving a more satisfying life is to be able to get to a level where I have financial freedom.

I shouldn't be paycheck to paycheck and not even being able to pay off my debts, I should be at least having a little bit of something at the end of the day and I don't so more money even if it's the same amount of hours just maybe more that I don't have to struggle. Um I'm the type, I don't mind going and camping, you know what I mean? Like I love to camp but I can't afford to because I can't afford to take off work to go camping for basically free because what is camping costs? I mean yeah, you might have to buy a tent um and like camping supplies, but once you buy them all you really need is clothes food and like first aid, you know, little things, things that you pretty much already have or and things that you're already gonna get, like you're already gonna buy food for yourself for those days anyway. So what's the difference, you know? Mhm. But I can't do that because I can't afford to take off.

Um one of my hobbies is making perfumes and sometimes it's hard to to see if I'm pouring them into the right place or or something like that. Like my depth perception is off small things and darkness and, and stuff like that. And I just, it would be really nice to not have to worry about seem period or feel like I could go out driving at night and feel confident in my abilities.

Like you see these Youtubers, these Youtubers make a lot of money and they only do Youtube and once you get youtube, you can, you know, do other things. You can do brand deals. You can put the money towards something else, like a, like a house, you know, rent the hat out, rent that house, rent that house out and create income, you know, um, the first step that I would take towards that goal, which I kind of already have, I have a Youtube channel but I only posted one. Only posted one video and then I stopped, but I would like to have a relationship channel because I feel like people love that stuff and that'll be really fun to document my life with my lover, you know, and yeah, I just noticed that I tend to watch a lot of videos like that on Youtube a couple couple channels and just deserving relationship and you know, learning from them. And um, ah, I guess since I want to make a couple channel, my first step towards that goal would be making the channel, which I already have done and then I guess putting myself out there to find A boyfriend I haven't dated in three years and um I think that I'm ready to start dating again. So yeah, I think of my life more satisfying because I would have a group of supporters and I really find it beautiful to like just capture moments in your life that will never happen again and post it. Um and to share it with people and let people, you know, be with the way they view it in blah blah and yeah, those will be there forever for people to view. Even if you're not with that person anymore, you still can view it and anyone can do it and you post on Youtube and it's just really cool. Did I answer the question I did reset it If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal? So my first step towards that goal would be I guess it could be creating the, will be creating no, the first step towards that goal is finding a partner, a nice high value partner and then, you know, starting to take videos on my iphone, doesn't have to be a fancy camera, you just take it on your phone and then upload it, take it from there, you know, and with that comes, you know, other stuff, you know, brand deals and um another source of income and all that stuff.

Um If there's a way to improve that, I think I would be I would have more satisfying life. There's also issues of um diet and I don't mean like lose weight diet because I'm actually average weight, maybe even towards thin, but I eat poorly. I've I got I think maybe it's the anxiety, whatever I eat poorly, I and I don't feel well for it and perhaps exacerbates the migraine situation. And I try to change that from time to time and then I think I don't I don't want to be eating this, I'd rather be eating this garbage or it seems like a lot of food hurts my stomach. And so I revert to eating like microwave, macaroni and cheese or something because it's the least upsetting to my stomach and then exercise, I'm just sedentary and I think given what I'm constantly told about exercise and mood, potentially exercise and migraines, I would feel better if I started exercising or just moving, I'm exaggerating.

How much of that is internal, how much of that is external. Um and and how I can try to address those, but I think the first step is to take a step back actually and think about really critically. What about your life do you like and what do you not like in order to identify the next steps? And I think thinking and introspect is a good way to do that, but also talking to people around you and saying, you know, what do you see me getting joy from or what do you get joy from? And learning about their experiences and how that is cohesive or not with your experiences can be really useful. Um but I definitely think in terms of first steps for more satisfying life. Taking a step back being introspective, talking to others, identifying why aren't you currently satisfied is the most important first step. You can't start taking action and tell you identify what's wrong in your current circumstance and what's going right in your current circumstance.

So job wise I can't really get much, but I also don't dream of labor. Not only I've never had a job that I just really wanted to do. I got it. I did psychology because I was interested in it.

So that's definitely something I should have done rather than psychology, which is only useful when you have a bachelor's or up and I just really didn't want to do that. It's interesting. But I don't need it and going back to school is definitely a no go, that's way too expensive. And then I'll have the student loans just to work at the library and I don't even know what that would even pay.

Like there are limits, we we impose so many limits on ourselves, and I find myself doing that um without like my full knowledge of it subconsciously subconsciously and um I'm trying to stop myself from doing that.

So I guess if I would say retrospect, I already did the first step, and the first step is making sure that I put my family first, you know, in front of everything else that is in my life to make sure that they're taken care of and protected.",90.87,326,215.252558600198,"2022-12-23T21:18:08.442Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-84716672-3a1f-4e96-a381-206ee6476952/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=62850929d863bbcde0ef538b&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a6167458c0b667437cc72e","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",16,"No"

So my first step towards a more satisfying life I guess it's a step I took a couple of years ago, which was to um eat better because I was definitely out of shape and overweight and a lot of that was was soda? If I have soda, I will eat to balance out the soda. And then because you know, soda has all that caffeine in it, I get addicted to it. I don't like coffee. So like soda is really my only source of caffeine. I don't like t either, but I really don't like coffee Anyway. So the stuff that I took to sort of change my life for the better was I put $200 into an envelope and I taped it to the wall and I put a date on it, that was like a month ahead and I told my brother that if I had soda before that date he got the money, he would take the envelope. And so that was a huge success for me because as soon as that money was on the line, it like completely removed the temptation to have soda. Um and so I've been using this system for the last couple of years now to mostly eat better. So I've eaten really well over the last couple of years, but this year I changed around a little bit and put like more proactive goals on the line, so it was all fitness goals this year, it was like 500 bucks to each of my siblings if I didn't accomplish like 50 consecutive pull ups, I'm sorry, that's a lot, 50 consecutive push ups and 15 consecutive pull ups. And um I was trying to run a sub 21 minute five K. And I have succeeded in the push up thing, but not the other two things, but I've gotten close, I can do 12 consecutive pull ups, which is better than the three I could do like six months ago. Um and I can run a sub 24 minute five K, which is way better than the like 35 minute five K. That I was running at the beginning of the year. So even if I have to pay those out, it's still totally worth it. Um and I realize now that I've answered this question sort of backwards, what would be your first step that I've told you what I have done already? So I guess uh imagining a more satisfying life from this point, I will continue that system. Um I think this next year I want to change up the envelopes to be not necessarily physical goals because I feel like I'm neglecting sort of mental creative side of things. So I'll probably establish bets with my siblings, not really bets, like one side bets, but I'll establish these things with my siblings to be like around some of my creative goals, Like write some music and writing some blog stuff. Um Yeah, things like that. Uh, so yeah, I guess my my first step towards the goals of more satisfying life is to find people that will hold you accountable for the little goals that will add up to a more satisfying life.

Um and I know that there's that saying that money can't buy you happiness, but I definitely think that it can ease any of those worries and it can help a lot of people around you. And I think that my first step to kind of getting to that point where I do feel more financially stable, not that I don't, it's just like more financially stable, more satisfying is just by finding another income stream. I've definitely had chats with friends about, oh, wouldn't it be fun to like do this together, do that together?

Obviously not even, I mean you don't know that's obvious, but I've been to the dentist before several times but I hate going so much that I don't go to like my regular checkups and things um for like cleaning some stuff. So I feel like if I was needed a more satisfying life, I would make a dentist appointment and I would actually follow through and going. But honestly like I feel like going to the dentist is definitely the one that I need to do to the most, but I don't like doctors or like medical appointments in general. Like I feel like if I was gonna do this then I would, you know, I would also make a therapist appointment, find a therapist. Um I'd probably make like a gynecologist appointment. I'd probably make like a regular health check up appointment. I'd probably like ask my regular doctor to check my blood like to get my blood tested and all of that. Um I'd probably go to the optometrist. I actually wear glasses but I haven't been to the optometrist in a few years. Um mostly because of Covid and I think it just exacerbated itself into like a much worse problem. So yeah, I would literally, I think I would just to make them to have a more satisfying life. I would literally just make all these appointments and actually follow through and go to them. Um What's kind of crazy about this is I feel like these are things that I could immediately do, like I could call all of these places and go and do all of these things, but I feel like I have such a fear of dealing with those, but after I went and did all of those things um I don't actually know what my next step for a satisfying life was probably to be like healthier, right? Like I think that's something that we all want to work on, so maybe I'd like, I don't know enter, I've always wanted to run a marathon. Not that I'll ever run a marathon because I don't think I'm capable of that, but I probably like I've never been ran a five K. I've never like, I mean I've ran the distance of a five K. Before, but I've never ran a five K. Race, so then after I made all my appointments I probably like enter five K. Um and then slowly work my way up.

My husband is a former professional athlete and I am a former athlete and also a former runner and cyclist. And several years ago I had a bike accident when I was in a cycling race and it caused the injuries and subsequent spine surgeries and those spine surgeries failed. And that really caused me to live with chronic pain and to not be as active and I guess I'm classified as disabled. I don't like to look at myself as disabled in any way, but I have permanent nerve damage and it's affected my um it affects me of course my pain level, but my ability to walk and run um and cycle. We have a home gym, we have a peloton bike and we have a soul treadmill and things like that in our home gym. But you know, I can't do the things I used to do, I can't go out and just ride a bike with confidence. Um I no longer can run because of the nerve damage that went from my neck all the way down to my right leg. So that's incredibly frustrating. And I thought about going overseas like to Germany, I've also consulted with the Mayo clinic here in the United States about revision surgeries in my cervical spine to see if that might help. But I also know from my neurosurgeon and my neurologist that I have some permanent nerve damage and those things can't be recovered. So I think if I could change one thing, it would be to find someone that I could work with to really help me to optimize my health and to build strength and muscle everywhere that I can, I know that there's nerve damage and certain things don't fire anymore and there's certain things I can't recover. But if I could do one thing, I think it would be my health. I have incredibly good genes. My parents were married over 65 years. Um, I don't have any health problems. I don't have high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol or sleep apnea or I've never had any weird negative blood test. I'm incredibly healthy with the exception of this chronic pain that I live with and my funked up spine.

Well 1st step, okay, I could still go on about this, I could, yeah, um and this might be very like not the ordinary, I actually don't really know what people are going to say to this question, but I think I would really work to make my relationship is more intentional. Um I would turn off my screens while some of the stuff I'm like in the process of doing like as a college student, you know, turning off my screens not having social media um learning to become more present in the moment um and not get lost in the the enslavement of technology, I'm just gonna say it, not all technology is bad, obviously, like I'm using a computer right now um but just being more intentional about my relationships and that I want to be present for these people and I want these people to be present for me. Um another thing I think would be just spending more time in prayer um because my relationship with the Lord is so foundational, everything else is going to sprout from that relationship with him um and I just, I wish that I had more willpower and more um yeah, strength to to pray more, I mean I think I do pray a good amount compared to like most people um but yeah, so more prayer um receiving the sacraments more, I would probably do that. So intentionality with relationships, intentionality with the Lord um it's his first step, but I kinda just wanna same thing. Um I think another thing, this is more like mental health wise would be to just learn how to deal with my emotions more because I can be very dramatic. Um Sometimes I am, I mean I think I've gotten a lot better but just becoming more aware of my emotions and like really putting them in check and addressing them whenever they need to be addressed. I mean again I think that this is something that has gotten a lot better since I entered college, but it's still something that I that I struggle with at times um that I have all this bundled up emotion, I don't know what to do with it.

I feel like that's the one thing I want right now, not to be dramatic, but if I have that, then I don't really care about anything else. I feel like not being able to support myself when I've been able to before is a really scary thought, I don't think anyone wants to feel like they can't, like they have to rely on other people.

Yes, it does. Yes. Yes, it does. I feel like when you grow up poor or you grow up in a low income household, you know, that may not necessarily buy happiness, but it ensures that you are secure, that you are safe, that you can do things that other people can do without having to worry if you'll have enough to put food on the table to pay rent, etcetera, etcetera.

Um Once you have money you're able to situate your living situation, your food and expensive situation, everything and everything and if you want to pursue higher education could go as well, find local colleges, find trade schools, find other programs um if not if you want to climb your corporate ladder or you want to go through there, you know make connections, do all these things, but I think the first thing would be to make money and in doing so I think that would rob me of a lot of issues and worries that I have nowadays and also I think we need a better life for me and it's from my partner and my intern, my partner has a better life than I have a better life and I see that as a stepping stone to more things, it's it's not the most important thing, but it is the first thing",97.04,234,144.682605111294,"2022-12-24T02:16:57.596Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-a082910b-2867-4e73-b85c-fd04bc76d5bd/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=611b1d3794ac948af7e57e7a&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a6507e4cbcaa7f598a59d6","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",12,"Yes"

Um, I have great relationships with my sisters. Uh, we're really close in many ways and I do feel like they're the closest people to me in my life. Um, so if I wanted to live a more satisfying life, I would definitely say that money causes a lot of stress in my family and in my marriage I make almost double what my husband makes in terms of a salary and he has been trying to get a new job for three years at this point and he hasn't, um, I personally think it's more because he hasn't been putting in an effort and he just thinks it's because um, the industry that he's in isn't hiring people or his degrees aren't specific enough, but either way he isn't making as much money as we need and the biggest stresses of my life just come from money. So I think just to have a more satisfying life and just to be, have less daily stress, we just to have more security financially within the family, so we would be able to buy things and be a little bit more comfortable and be a little bit more secure. Um, I find a lot of stress in thinking about if we were to have an issue arise in the house, something would break or we need to like a last minute repair. We would be completely unprepared to cover such a large expense.

I can probably start off probably the, if my goal was more satisfying life, I probably started since I got out of high school, which I was on, I was gonna join the military and you know, I went through the whole rig a war, you know, all the way down to getting physicals and and you know, and all this, we were gonna do the buddy system however, you know, that didn't work out, so I decided not to join and came back home and started working doing, you know, other type of jobs, which you know, once you do that, your your life's leading into another direction. So you know the thing you come to a fork and run, you got different ways to go. So you know, that was my fork and you know, I pretty well believe that I just took the wrong fork because I think if I did go in the military and you know, stayed in there, I think my life would have been totally different. I mean, I could have got seen probably more more of the world, you know, which, you know, I've been a lot of places anyway and um you know, and probably met different people probably would have gotten married to somebody else and have, you know, to keep my kids would be different. So, you know, there's a lot to think about, I mean, you know, when you get that fork, I mean, but I think I would have had a better satisfying life and you know, if I went that way um which my life is satisfying now, and I've still got some steps to go to meet my goal, which, you know, I got that in play right now. Uh it's still gonna take me a little bit to achieve what I'm going, but there is some steps that already done, you know? Um and I'm still working on the steps, so this is 11 of them my goals in progress right now, and so uh already took the first step, you know, I quit one job, you know, I started doing other things, you know, trying to get, you know, everything in order. So, you know, I'm still working on that goal, so uh only another year, I will achieve that goal and then I'll get another goal.

I really think like the quality of your life um at least I'm speaking for myself, but I think it can be applied more generally to that. The quality of one's life is um reflected in the quality of the relationships that you have. So I don't know, maybe like if I'm thinking about strengthening the relationship with myself, I think a first step towards that goal would be either journaling on a regular frequency or like talking to myself as weird as that might sound on a regular basis. Um Yeah, I mean I'm already in therapy, but I think it's like important to like cultivate some kind of self awareness, self reflection practice outside of therapy. Yeah, so I think I would say like journaling or talking to myself something that like, strengthens the relationship I have with myself so that I, you know, I hate myself less.

R never regret is all the work I did with all those troubled teens and my own kids because now I have 19 Children that are all grown and self sufficient, responsible in their own homes and their own jobs and they take care of themselves and their bills and they're their significant others and the ones that have kids, they take care of their Children very well. And I know that I had a major impact in all of that. So for that I am truly proud and grateful. Um I wish though, or I guess I had thought, and when back in those days when looking forward to this period in my life, I I assumed that I would still be interactive even though they might not be living with me anymore. I figured I would be raising grandkids and and watching them all the time and taking them to the zoo and the parks and, and just still being me, the kid person only now it would be with grandkids and I want to be, I just cannot get my motivation back. And I wish I knew how. I really wish I could find a way to do that. You know, I wish I could. I really, that's what I would want to be.

Is it a better connection to my fiance? Is it a more loving and communicative relationship with my parents? Um you know, the materialistic versus the meaningful?

Um I really can't see myself ever being married but about 253 and I am a little more open to it because I don't have Children of my own and when my mother passes away I won't really have any family left. And so I just feel like if I finally let myself connect to another person and that leads to marriage, how at least have a sense of family. So um I guess the step that I would take in order to reach that goal is, well I guess I've already taken it because I've made up my mind that when I get close to someone again that if the subject of marriage comes along, I won't just run away um because I feel that they want more than I do. Um I'm just at a point in my life where I think I just want to go for it to ensure that I'm not alone the rest of my life and die alone",125.16,253,121.284755512943,"2022-12-24T09:52:17.380Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-da6618cd-7fb5-41e2-958c-c2d972c682fc/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=61271f78fcb1178e49430e34&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a6bfe44ed4be67843b38c7","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",12,"No"

I would definitely get more organized. I feel like I built a small house on my father's property, very isolated here. It's pretty much my own place. It's a place that I can fall back on what I need to as I have in the last year, um I lost my storage unit that I had a lot of my previous life in it and I moved it into his house and that needs to be organized because it's just chaos and it is a destructive distraction in the back of my head. And the same applies to my living space that I'm in. It is distracting and I know that that's something that I need to knock out before I can focus on the other steps to take, to get my life where I want it to be. So organization is the first part for sure. Uh less cleanliness, more clutter, but it's an, it's an incredibly crazy amount of clutter. Um just a life built up and a life built up where I lost a lot of stuff when I was younger. So you find that you have that need to like hold on to things a little bit more and I need to shed some of that. I need to sell some things and I need to feel clean and safe in my place to where my distraction isn't everything is awful and messy and instead I can start writing down what I wanna do what I need to do, where I need to save money, where I need to put it and how the heck I'm going to live a happy life and make the money I need to make and escape from not wanderlust, but from not being able to freely have that wanderlust. I don't know, it's the answer. The simple answer is to get organized because there is no way anybody can have a satisfying life surrounded by chaos, at least clutter chaos. There are of course, positive chaos is that you should surround yourself with, because there, I think inherently inspiring this this chaos that I have is not it?

That would lead to a more satisfying life, health being healthy and feeling good.

I used it to get my teaching degree and I would probably start delving into their data analytics bachelor's program. Maybe getting some courses done on the side for a cheaper math that I could transfer in while I'm still teaching. Um I'll probably do that honestly over the next year or two.

So uh, I don't know, everybody would have to immediately know who I was. So I'd have to get a magic wand. Uh I have to get dictatorial powers over the United States of America. So all the stupid people didn't have a say, we put solar roofs and wind on every home. Uh we would put every farm, uh nobody would have a long and everybody would have to grow, grow, grow food and we would rotate out if it's, you know, 75 or 66% of the land. So we don't over farm, we would put nuclear power plants in underneath the mountain ranges of, you know, the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian mountains, so they're already covered by concrete. So if they blow up, nothing happens. So people don't have to worry about it's unsafe and the radiation fix that problem for you plenty of power, infinite power. Now, we can sell all the food, all the power To all the other countries. We just edit world hunger. We just paid off the national debt, there's 100% employment, everyone has a job. And now, because strawberries are cheaper than whatever garbage food, everyone's a lot healthier. So we can give free health care to everyone and now school becomes cheap so we can do free education and we substitute that with tax cuts on trade schools and things like that. And uh, you know, we have apprenticeships and you know, we bring that back And so, uh, you four year apprenticeships and then after that they become a layman and then they become experts. And by the time somebody spends 12 years they can become a master and then they can start training other people and you increase, there's paying their salary based on that. So somebody, uh, decides what field they go into based on their educational, uh, you know, scores, uh, and based on their wishes. So they would take a test saying these are the top 10 fields that I love. And then they take a test saying these are the top 10 fields I perform in you cross reference that and you get everybody in the field that they love and perform well in, you know, so how, I don't know, how do I, how do I make that happen? Right. And believe me, I've got 40 other things too balancing the budget and, you know, making sure congress cannot exempt themselves too many laws banning lobbyists preventing the seven different ways that voting, uh, screws ourselves because all of the state should be voting in the primary on the same day. Why is it that new Hampshire and south Carolina vote first and then presidents drop out. It's a way to read the elections just like jerry mandaric. So all this stuff has to stop, you know, but, you know, citizens United has to go away. Um, making sure that we can now then spend all this extra money that we were having into space colonizing, then we can get out of each other's way. And then everybody could have a colony of of whatever you want to do. You have conservatives, liberals, nudists, religious people, Atheist all in different places because you are all over the galaxy doing whatever you want to mining asteroids, bringing back so much money and resources that we all have enough to go around, you know? So we make it hard on ourselves because we want it to be hard because we're stupid and people like stupidity, you know, like I said, I can solve all these problems. So how do I get to that goal? I have no freaking clue has always been my problem. I have the answers to the big solution, but I don't know how to take the first step because I damn sure about running for office. I don't want to be around people. They'll shoot me dead anyway by the time I even start spewing this nonsense off. So no, I would have to be the guy in the Shadows. And uh, you know, it's who like I said, nobody wants to listen to a guy who's 42 years old from Florida. Nobody's listening to me. You guys are probably thinking I'm crazy anyway. But that's the thing is that the craziest people are the biggest geniuses. They're the ones that need to be listened to the most. So, uh, I can easily reform the government and then after 10 years, give it back because I damn sure, don't want it and then just go away like Cincinnatus.

And then I would look at the stretch goals and think, okay, what make a plan, what do I need to do to try to reach those stretch goals? And I also make another list that have the things that were not going well in my life. And I try to figure out are these things that are within my control or are they things that I can do something about. And if there's something I can do something about, I would try to take steps toward dealing with that unsatisfactory aspect of my life. I actually have experience doing this, I usually would do it if I was feeling depressed about something, I'd make lists of positives and negatives in my life and tackle the negatives and figure out what I even had any control over.

Um I don't know from my position, I feel like I'm kind of continuously struggling to get on that I keep following behind on tasks and feeling like oh I just need to catch up and then I can work on this, that and the other thing, that's the stuff I really want to work on and envisioning being more focused and doing more cooking is a big one, but that's truly the hardest question because what is satisfying is some, I find a lot of things satisfying, I find so many things satisfying that I think my biggest problem is getting caught between satisfying ideas or options and not succeeding in choosing one and kind of just doing, you know wasting time on twitter and the like where it's not really truly satisfying, but I didn't have to make a decision. So I think if I were to, I don't know if it's exactly the first step, but I think that the most effective way I could find to have a more satisfying life would be to figure out how to spend more time on any of the many things I find satisfying and less time on the, I don't know what to do. So here's what I'm going to do activities that are definitely less satisfying and that's really hard. Making those decisions is hard and so often when I'm doing something that is relatively satisfying, I'll find myself thinking about, oh but maybe I should be working on X. Y. Z. Instead or oh it would be nice to be kicking back and reading instead. So I think that figuring out how to get more direct with myself about what I want to do and how much of it I want to do would get me closer towards a more satisfying life than any specific activity basically asking and answering some hard questions about what would be satisfying rather than, because I already know many things I find satisfying. I love doing volunteer work. I love spending time with friends. I like um studying and learning especially foreign languages, but it's actually doing those things instead of faffing around on Reddit, which is not nearly as satisfying.

So it's very often that I'm working in the evenings or the weekend trying to catch up from things I didn't get a chance to do during the week As a result. I have not taken like a real vacation besides visiting family for short duration. Um, in years, uh, my husband used to work out of town, um building construction projects. So I would go visit him and we would explore wherever he was, whether it was Las Vegas or boston or Canada. Um, so it allowed us to integrate vacations into his work locales, but since he retired almost four years ago, we no longer have that option and so we haven't taken a vacation in all that time. Um, my husband also has some medical issues. So picking up and traveling at the drop of a hat is not really an option. So if there was something and as a result of the recent obstacles I faced with the hurricane, it's kind of given me a renewed lease on life and to understand that you can't just keep putting things off. So one of my goals from here on out is to take a real vacation for like say at least a week every year and go do something, go somewhere that we haven't been before, whether it's here in the US or maybe overseas, but I'm afraid that if we put it off too long, that will just run out of time.

So I guess my first life to being more satisfied might be to have somebody hand me half a million dollars. Um Not because it would let me buy things or anything that would make my life more satisfying, but just because it would give me a cushion that would be more satisfying, a sense of ease about you know the washer goes out and I don't freak about it, that kind of stuff. So I guess my first step if I wanted more satisfying would be just a little more money in the bank, not a whole lot, don't need a whole lot. Um But other than that like I said I find my life really satisfying. I can't imagine I'm sitting here trying to think and I can't imagine something that I would need to add to it to make it more satisfying. Um I think just to stay mentally active and interested in things is satisfying. So like one of the things I'm gonna pursue when I graduate when I graduate, God again when I retire, one of the things I'm gonna pursue is um some more education already got two degrees, but in my state if you're over 60 you can go to some of the colleges for free, so I will be pursuing that shortly. Um And I think that will be immensely satisfying. But again, my overall answer, this question is I don't need to add anything to it to make it more satisfied.

I think they think that they have to do these big like life changing crazy things And not everyday people are able to do such as I don't know like get this major promotion at work or something like that and that's going to change everything and get this new job that's going to change everything or you know, go to the gym and get really, really big or buff and that's going to change everything. Like if you're a guy or something like that that cares about that or you know, losing a bunch of weight or something like that. you know what I mean? Like just crazy things like that.

If you can focus on doing the little things, then all of those big things will eventually come, you will get that promotion, you will lose all of that way, you will, you know, get those muscles and get bigger, you you know, you're going to get no girlfriend or boyfriend or something like that.

So I have to think of something and I put it in the back of my mind and then it comes back around again because I tend to have obsessive tendencies and all I'm doing is winding it tighter and it's in layers and if you think about it yarn is just string like five pieces of string woven together. And I guess those could be like the threads could be like our experiences and so I'm taking those and just rolling it around myself inside and now that I understand that it's like I can figure out how to undo that by looking at these situations and how they're threatened together to be able to overcome that. And I think that would be my first step towards my goal of living a satisfied life where I teach Children how to express themselves healthily. So the world is full of people who are more understanding and who are willing and wanting to know how another person is feeling and being able to have human decency and consideration for others and like to me that seems like such a normalcy, like I don't even know how the world is so inconsiderate and like how I view things seems like it's not even like I have a high standard, I just think that that's it's second nature, it should be just second nature, just I guess first nature would be better. And so to actively see that that's not how people live, it's been a really interesting uh perception, I needed a base because I view things in such a way that should be natural that aren't and so I think the first step is just learning how to overcome my own emotional shortcomings so that when I teach the Children and they face these, I can show them with understanding and guidance that it is possible and teach them healthy ways to express ourselves. Because we all want to be heard, we all want to be accepted for who we are, so we have to accept ourselves first, I think.",204.29,573,168.290175730579,"2022-12-25T22:03:46.118Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-8a0bb3a4-edb3-405a-896e-273f66e82b7d/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5b184f9768a5ed0001734190&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a8b986095d9f6b3200a89b","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",18,"DATA_EXPIRED"

Um Again, going back to a question I answered previously, one thing I definitely don't have now is long term financial security I can get by if I quit my job right now, I could probably make it a year or two just living off savings after that, I'd be completely broke. So I don't have a lot saved up for retirement, which is something that's kind of scary going forward. Social Security is gonna be gone most likely by the time I'm old enough to get it. So I try not to think about too far in the future because there's so many unknowns, but as far as a satisfying life, I feel very satisfied in life right now and it's just because as I've grown up, my my thinking has changed instead of focusing so much on finances and being wealthy to show my success to the friends and family, I just started to do what makes me happy doesn't make me a lot of money doesn't make me the most successful in my field. But I wake up, I don't have stress in my life, I don't have to worry about, you know, my work performance and getting that big promotion or things like that, I just live day to day and I feel good about what I'm accomplishing and how my life is going forward. So to me it's already satisfying. I guess if that was my goal, the first step would be maybe budgeting better my finances setting up like a retirement account or a different type of savings account to save more money for the future.

But because of our financial constraints, it's hard to enjoyed activities in which they, they cost uh more money than that, which we can afford. And so my goal would be to find a side hustle some side job or some money making method out there that I could do at home in which I can pick away at it and save that money so that my girls can have a better opportunity to experiment more activities and and be able to get close to a few in which I know they would be able to excel at.

It makes me feel, um um, I don't know. It brings me satisfaction to accomplish things in in work and to get paid for it. So to be more satisfied with my life, I feel like I do need to find a career that's a good fit for me, um and I feel like I am doing those steps I am applying. Um maybe a little too much.

Like I feel like I thought the world really just beat me up and not be able to do anything about it and I think that's literally my first step that I would take is to honestly re evaluate what I want and just be like, well, get up, get up and find what you want to do and do it as well and do it as well as you can. And I think that's the best thing anyone can honestly do is just put their best out there and see how far you get. Some people might need to take a couple tries, some people who are lucky enough to get on the first swing, but to some extent you just have to put your best foot forward and I feel like that's what my first step would be, Just honestly, just get up, have that, have a good mentality, positive mentality and just be like, I'm ready to start my life and to start having better and greater things happen to me.

Um one where I could be paid more maybe. Um As of right now I am a Shiflett at um a little food place on the campus that I I I attend the campus I live on at and as a shift lead I don't feel like my pay really represents the responsibilities I have. So I would probably look for a job that would pay me the right amount for the responsibility for the responsibilities I partake in. I'm in charge of or a job that would involve last responsibilities because even now I received a small raise and I'm still being paid well below what a shift should be being paid and the responsibilities are just countless. So if I wanted a more satisfying life I would search for a job with either less responsibilities or better paper responsibilities. I would also probably exercise more. Um Although I'm pretty satisfied not exercising so I'm not sure if I would do that. But I think honestly finding a new job would help me gaining more satisfying life completely. I really do think it would do that. But I might have to, I might have to go for a job that pays less with better hours as eventually moving through the ranks would allow me to To receive the right pay. For example, I have a friend who works at Starbucks on campus as a ship lead and she makes $14 an hour which still isn't great but it is much better And they start at 11, I get paid 12 as a shift lead at the place I work that is also on campus. And if I started at Starbucks brand new I would probably start at 11. But I might be able to negotiate to 12 if I told them I was a shift lead somewhere else.

Um whether it's, you know, um working at volunteering at like kitchens or soup kitchens and things like that and you know helping people want, you know, one person at a time get on their feet, you know, um it could be something as little as providing a meal to long term where you're trying to get people to have a you know, slightly more comfortable and positive life, I think that's kind of the realistic situation that I would find myself in later on in my in my life.

Uh making money really money is so central to what can fix me. If I had money, I can fix myself disability and everything in just weeks to the point where I can be very productive. In fact, it probably be faster. I would say within three weeks if I had enough money to pay for the things I need for my disability, like the powered wheelchair which has been taken over a year now trying to get and it's probably gonna take many more months have done another year, five monthly, I just buy one out right and forget that. And if I had a parent wheelchair, I would be able to do things physically and I would be able to work even and be able to cook my own food and stuff like that cookie mon food would save me money working would make me money, but I need money to be able to get the powered wheelchair to get medicines, I need to get the doctor appointments, I need, I need money for all that that I don't have. And if I did, I would probably knock out some of my disabilities completely and be able to live with the others. And it's really aggravated how things work out go against a disabled person. It's like they make you hold you down so you can't work and stuff when in reality, if you could work, you wouldn't need help with the disability. But you know, people in government are stupid people, politicians especially are so the stupidest people, stupidest creatures even they have ever walked the face of this planet. In any case, the first step would be making money, which is what I'm doing even here in prolific believing not doing this very study is making me enough money to get some medicine that I need to actually live. My insulin copay will be paid for by this very study for this next month of insulin. That's what I'm dealing with. That's why I get so angry with researchers sometimes when they're when it will think about people when they got their own mental problems to put it in their surveys and stuff because they have real life consequences. It was researchers just don't care about paying. I Well, anyway, first step is making money. 2nd step is trying to control my temper.

My first step would be to get out of this town, to get out of the city I'm in and just find, go back to what I was doing, which was very much about me. It was very much a personal quest. I was going to go see the rest of the 50 states. It was a dream I had as a kid, I had this idea as a kid when I first traveled to New York City. So honestly 30 states by the time I'm 30 and I made that happen on the 30th birthday and made it to the state number 30. That was pretty cool, drove into Wisconsin. So I think that's the direction I drove one I either Wisconsin. So I drove across the border line into the other one I was at first, but like I was made that happen and then I was, I was on the road, I had a year to do it. I had six states left, I was gonna do this and I got to state number 46 when everything fell apart And then, you know, on the way back and I hate to shake number 47 Arkansas. Um, it was a bizarre experience, but I went to Arkansas and enjoyed it and then came home to fix this problem and we haven't been able to leave. So um, if I had a more satisfying life, I would go back to that to finding, to finding a goal that I had for myself and and fulfilling it because I'm not anymore not fulfilling any goal. I read a book this summer, like a little Children's book, it's a little heavy and I need to fix a lot of things about it from the way there's my book and I just kind of set it down because I showed it to some people and I got some mixed responses and lukewarm interest and from friends and family and just whatever and like that was a goal I set for myself and I always wanted to be a writer. So here was my chance to be a writer and I tried it, I got a whole thing written and the whole thing designed and everything ready to go and I look for a editor who's in Children's books, couldn't find anyone that would do it for royalties. I don't have money for that anyways. But the point is I like to make a more satisfying life. I kind of figured I would want to find that piece of me that there's some sort of like goal that I had and go for it. I just haven't gone for anything in a long time and I have, I've got this job I'm supposed to be, I haven't finished the application for it because honestly, I just don't want it. It sounds so boring and I need to be engaged, but it's it's like, it's like the answer to a solution. It's it's an answer. It'll get me moving doing something, but am I gonna get stuck here and doing that probably. Um And that kills me and so I would find the next thing I would do is find a job that I wanted to be doing it. Maybe go back to my business that was almost there is getting there. I was excited about it. I made some money out of it turned a profit That much is $5 across the gamut. I turned a profit in middle of the summer downturn Instead of 20 years. There you go. Um you know? But yeah like I would go back to doing that sort of something that Barry did I do you know find that goal and go for it. I don't know what those goals are anymore. They feel very separated from me and they feel very unreal and um people say oh what I wanna do with my life, who the funk knows like I don't know anymore. Like why would you ask me these stupid questions? Like what do I want to do with my life? I would like to go back to being wealthy and having money and people doing whatever I tell them to do because I have money. That's what I miss that. That's something I'm missing my whole career is having the money all the time and like working three or four days a week and making 125,000. That was nice. I would miss the money in the hours, that's not a thing they go back for. But I want, I wish I could find that kind of that satisfaction and something that work. I haven't found a job that that that really fulfills that I thought I did and then they didn't like me. I don't know what to do, how I need to find what I was passionate about because that's what soured about the career too is I wasn't I wasn't focused on why I joined the whole helping other people thing. I just was doing it because I could do it and I was chasing the dollar and I made a lot of money and I did a lot of things but it wasn't making me happy. In fact I was turning into that person, that guy unhappy guy who would refuse to admit that he was unhappy and tried to make everyone else happy work. That's what I was doing by the time I quit, By the time I launched a projectile of my boss's head in Key west florida. How about that?

I would also um changed my lifestyle for my diet and my physical activity because I already practiced most of this, but I kind of been slacking since I stopped doing sports.

I got my PhD, I could probably do that for a living at a university level which I think would be a lot more rewarding, ideally meaning at the university, probably not going to make more money, but theoretically with that education could make a lot more money in the private setting which would in the long run give me more free time, could maybe retire earlier or like have better hours or something theoretically, which is ultimately I think what creates more satisfaction for me is just more free time to engage with the things that I enjoy rather than with responsibilities that I have to do like work.

I felt more confident, I felt stronger, I felt secure, I felt happier. So I don't think everyone needs to lose weight to be happy. I think a lot of people can be any weight they want to be and, and that's good for them and healthy for them. But for me personally, it would just start by being nice to have clothes that fit again since I've outgrown most of the ones I have and I feel like I'm squeezing into super tight clothes from two years ago. Um, so if I were to live a more satisfying life, I feel like that would start with being satisfied with the body that I'm in and the body that I'm working with every single day. I'm pretty content where I am education wise and career wise, relationship wise has been a struggle, but in my opinion, that's not something you can do anything about that will just come when it comes. I think you find people when you're not looking for them. And I think I'm in a pretty healthy mindset for a relationship. Well, I was until recently, but I'm taking a break right now.

And if you mean like right at this instant, what step or what would I have to like go back and have made my first step, I'm not sure what you mean, but I will say for a more satisfying life, my first step would have been to not make the big mistake that I made that is like holding me back right now. But I'm also, I mean to get a more satisfying life now, I don't even honestly know how I mean. I have done research online and look for answers and ways and, and I don't find it. It's some companies and businesses will talk a good game, but nobody's there to really help. Um It sucks really, really, really bad. The federal government, they don't care, They don't look at individual situations, it's blank. It'd like to where I'm just affected like everybody else, which I'm not saying I don't need to be like punished or anything, but the amount that I'm going through is like kind of ridiculous. It gets hard to deal with it at times with other stuff going on in life. Um So I mean honestly, I really don't even know what my first step right now would be, but definitely like when I would go back when my dad died and like not make that mistake and um I would still have problems in my personal life, I'm sure, but my professional life would be a much better position because I was in a really good spot. And um, pretty much like I made it to where I wanted to be like already. So even if I had lost that job, like I did, but like not have this other situation going on. I feel like I'd still be living a way more satisfying life. And if I would have just had possibilities now would be good. It's just hard to be stuck in a job that I'm absolutely hating. The company is horrible. I make almost half of what I used to make and it just, there's nothing to do about it. My son likes to think there is, but companies don't care. They just don't care. There's no one out there really that cares and the government surely doesn't care.

Um So I think My first step for more satisfying life would be to buy a house closer to work um one to have my own home be able to do what I want in it as far as like you know, flooring or paint or light fixtures, you know, any of that stuff and also being able to create a little like workshop space in the garage or a shed in the back or whatever um Just so I can have a place to play without worry of disturbing neighbors or damaging something that I have to pay for. Um And then also because it would seriously cut down on my commute, I drive a vehicle that does not get great miles to the gallon. Um So it's about $100 a week just to build my tank to get to work and back. So I think in a lot of ways of being able to own a home near my job would mentally improve my life, You know, saving money.

Um Because honestly that's the key to a more satisfying life um is to not you can it's not that it's bad to want for more and pursue more, but to find satisfaction in what you do have or recognize um the silver linings or the or the positive points or you know, just find things to be grateful for in your current life are really the key to feeling more satisfied. Um So I mean I guess that kind of that kind of takes the takes the cake is my answer. I was gonna say the other thing I was hovering between would be for me to have a more satisfying life would be to break my food addiction. Um I think I could probably get a lot done if I could get a handle on that because again, like I even said in one of my previous answers, I will purposefully eat, I will just emotionally eat knowing that I will feel like shit just so that I can purposefully disarm myself from having the motivation to do anything that will disturb my current status quo. Food is is a toxin for me and that's not all food. Obviously healthy food is not a toxin for me, but I I weaponize it, I wield it like a weapon towards myself and um I have to find satisfaction in things other than food. I mean I guess that really kind of ties back into the gratefulness, finding finding things in my life to be grateful for and feeling like that's enough being able to stand on the strength of that. That's not to say that I don't because if if I did in my mental state would be in tatters compared to where I'm at now. But sincerely, food is way too much of a centerpiece in my life. Everything revolves around. If I think about food, I think about what I'm gonna eat next, what I'm going to eat. Um it's just a literal obsession. It's an addiction I think, and I need to get a better hold on that and anyone who's addicted to anything can greatly improve their life by kicking their addiction. And so um yeah, I mean, those two answers kind of go hand in hand for attitude and my poor eating habits are problems with food, but first step, I don't know, I think first that would maybe be gratitude for funk. I don't know, I mean really, I'll say this, I think the gratitude would be easier for me to do, although I think the urgency of trying to keep the food addiction would take precedence, but I don't think that would be as easy for me to accomplish.

Um the goal to have a more satisfying, satisfying life is assumed by by people who have Children and they under normal circumstances, they would assume that they would uh have goals for their Children, that those Children would have a sad, more satisfying life, but that didn't happen for me. Uh the adults around me were only uh pursuing what they wanted to do. They were uh people who, you know, just wanted to satisfy their their um their own goals and their own um uh indulgences, especially indulgences, and uh that meant sacrificing um uh their things that they should have provided for their Children, and that was that happened on an ongoing basis. So, goals that um uh goals for a person to achieve to get a more satisfying life was never instilled in me or in my sibling and um which is, which is which is a terrible thing because that the kid has never learned that, and I can't figure it out uh at the developmental stages of their life that they should have, and that that means that they have to struggle with that at a later time when it it becomes a uh you know, a crisis point or something like that, and um you know, sometimes the decision is bad and often it is bad. So, um that struggle when it was an ongoing thing, uh an ongoing theme throughout my life, and the uh the things that I chose to do to get to a more satisfying life were probably not things that I would have done if I had been raised properly, So at 65, um I now, you know know that this has all happened, it's all in the past and uh I understand, you know, what went wrong and uh you know, it's it's it's taken as much time to figure out how to how to create a satisfying life as it is to to figure out the things the mistakes that I made, and then also have to understand that those mistakes that I made were not even my fault to begin with.

The sooner you're out of debt the less uh you owe others of your resources, allowing an increase of your resources to be more percentage of your own.

So if it were for me, I would definitely figure out how to get that balance right. And unfortunately, I think that even though it's totally not my generation, I think I would try to go back to the office more right, It's so convenient to work from home, it's so nice to just roll out of bed and be like clocking in, you know, start the clock for my eight hours right now. But I think that going to the office and then leaving the office, it really makes it satisfying to be in your home and find that peace and that lack of obligation, you know, your home and it is absolutely not work here.

So now I'm just at this place where I need to learn how to interact like a normal person or at least how to not make people uncomfortable and I don't know what it is about me that makes people uncomfortable.

But overall, the simple answer is that my first step toward having a more satisfying life would be to make a plan for that, Make a plan for what I would judge is satisfying and then break it down into the daily actions that will help me reach that goal. So for me, if I think about more satisfying, I felt if I were at a target B. M, I then my life would be more satisfying because my body would be working well, I would have the energy that I need to move through life so to get there, I know that weight loss is an important part of that. So I would journal out those things that I'm going to do daily in order to meet that goal um and I can make those goals and those gold plans in every aspect of my life. I think having a strong faith will make more satisfying life. So if I break that down into daily actions, that will lead to that, Then I know that I'm eventually gonna have a satisfying life and not expecting it to come in day one, day two or even day 30 or 60 or 90.

My goal is like that. Um I have more control over and that I can meet all my financial needs, I can be a contribute, it's all. And so my first step in all of that was getting clean of course, and my next step after that was losing my job. Thank you pandemic, I'm sorry about that, but it really saved my life and uh I got out of a job and I quit drugs and that I hated. And so since I've got, I've moved states, I've come to colorado and um but last year when I was seeing my sisters in texas, I applied for a boot camp scholarship program and I got in and that started that cohort started a month ago and I'm more than halfway through now. So that is my main step is changing myself uh job wise, career wise so that I can change my economic situation. Um I know money isn't the answer to everything, but having enough to pay your bills is it's being able to make that, you know, instead of being stuck, no matter what, no matter how hard you work, that's important.

I often I can quite struggle to pay rent sometimes, or to pay for some of the necessities and therefore making more money would be the first step towards more satisfying life was it would be satisfying to not be stressed and worried about money all the time. Um For me to make money that of course is its whole own issue. I work with my father and a family business and just the nature of the business we've been struggling on the last few years in particular. Um Everything started to crash a little bit when, when the economy tanked in 2008, so we've been working twice as hard since then to to get to the same place. Um And since the pandemic, you know, things just tanking and harder. So it's been, it's been a really difficult few years money wise, um I'm kind of stuck at work because I do work for my father. He can't afford to bring in anybody else. If I really wanted to make more satisfying life, I would would take steps to change things at work and change things to where money was was coming in a little more easier.

So for me, like I like to say that I have like a hobby situation going on that like it's really hard for me to balance hobbies because I have so many things that I enjoy, but when I was talking it out I realized that I kind of have these different areas, so I have like a passive active activity which would be like reading, have a passive activity which is like watching tv movies, I have creative activity which would be like journaling or watercolor or some sort of art or I don't know um maybe gaming, we can also say gaming is passive active and then you have active like workout activities that would be dancing or yoga, like I need to feel happy when I'm doing that as well and then finally we have learning because I love to learn, I want to learn forever and ever and ever and ever. So for me, like I really like literally that came down to working out or learning like I'm going to choose learning all day long because I know that that's what's going to make me feel the most fulfilled, so I'm learning, like learning a new language and and then I guess I have recently learned that I'm not an extroverted introvert, but for an introverted extrovert, but rather an extrovert. So I think that I need to make sure I'm seeing my friends and getting outside the house and like meeting new people like more than once a week. Um I don't think once a week just on the weekends is enough, like, you've got to do this more than once a week in my case, And that's going to make me feel the most happy.

That is a hard question for me because we have enough retirement money in the bank now that we could make some big changes if we wanted to make some changes and that's forced us to very much visit the kinds of things that we do and the kinds of things that we would love to do in an ideal world and what the gap is between those things and the more we look at that gap, the more we decide that the things we're doing are the things that we want to do. So we don't go on vacations as much as we would like. But the reason we don't go on vacations as much as we would like is because when we stay home, we get to play our instruments in a small band and in a large community band. And we really, really, really like spending time playing instruments in the small and large band. So if we were looking for a more satisfying life, we have to understand what that more satisfying life would look like. So I guess that would be the first step in the goal is to try to understand what do we want to do. But this is something that my wife and I talk about a lot. We do a lot of driving vacations and so we get a lot of chances to talk and, and we talk over, are we doing the things that we want to do. Do we want to do less playing in the band. Do we want to fold the small ensemble that we run? Do we want to cut back the business that my wife runs? Um, and, and, you know, the answers on that are always know. We don't really want to do that.

I gotta put all music and playing music and musicianship on the back burner, especially because of covid restrictions and other things, but also, you know, as an artist, you have periods of time where you feel less and more connected depending on the scenario to music in general.

Um, so just to see that it's just very small compared to when I grow up and we had many more, you know, cousins and get together with cousins all the time, it's very disheartening to me and to know that, you know, my kids grew up, they're not going to have that cousin relationship because they just don't have it now because of the age difference. So that is one thing that I've noticed that is very disappointing. Um, so if I was to change something, I guess I would have made it much more of a point to try to get people to connect better. Um, even when it comes to friends, I do have friends, but again, their kids are different ages. So, um if I had one thing to do, it would be to have that big group of either friends and family. Um, you know, whether we had had more Children, if we had started younger to have more of that. Um I just think that that's one thing that I didn't regret anything in life. I mean everything happens for a reason and you know, my thing is you learn from everything. Um even the hardest of things you try to I guess learn from it, but um if I was able to have had kids, maybe a little bit younger and maybe had a couple more kids just to bring more of that family for future, you know, if I had had more kids and they had kids like that, just the family aspect would grow.",126.06,367,174.678724416944,"2022-12-28T17:33:46.561Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-4be64a2d-f46b-4329-ad8d-cceeec641b29/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=611c2ed2d1d6a90e05ceeb30&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63ac7971522c3c37fc3a6465","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",30,"No"

Um It's something where you can have your passions be on the side, whether it be a side project, just a hobby, but having something that you're doing for a majority of your work week, being fulfilling and satisfying I think is such an important start and so many people are unfulfilled by the work that they do, they just feel like they're slogging by, they feel like what they're doing doesn't matter if they just didn't show up, uh there wouldn't be any difference and I think that's so disappointing.

So I would say to identify um would be the first step towards having a more satisfying life, identify what that means to me or define what that means to me. Yeah because that could be different. I mean that is different for everybody, some people don't want more money, some people want better health, some people will be more satisfied with um different experiences, so I guess it really just depends.

Exactly. In pursuit of finding a more satisfying life I left the practice of law, which I had grown too absolutely despise I was physically ill from the stress and then the anxiety and then the depression that set in after that I had expressed health problems over it. Once I got my depression and my health problems treated, I turned away from that life completely and set out on the road to find something much simpler if I hadn't found satisfaction in complicated success and professional exploits. So I turned exactly the other way to try to find something else I sold or gave away almost everything I had and moved into an RV. And for the last six years have been going from job to job and area to area and uh usually wilderness locations. Um and I have found satisfaction in a very, very simple way of life. There have been times in my life where the most stressful and crucial thing I needed to accomplish was getting drinking water or not freezing during the night or escaping a wildfire. Uh and over the course of my adventures, then I've decided I I ended up finding a new life goal that I want to pursue. And I've been researching towards that goal as well. So my first step towards getting a more satisfying life was to take a very large step in the opposite direction of what I was not finding satisfying if that makes sense. I think a lot of people, it seems to me a lot of people who are dissatisfied with their life keep on doing the same things that they've always been doing and they just try to perhaps do them in a different way or with different people.

So that could be sitting down with a planner that could be sitting down with a budget that could be sitting down with other things.

I would ponder on what I've written and another thing I would do is take inventory and stock like self assessment. Um and I don't mean just like, oh, I'm a good person because I think that's relative, I think that depends on who you're, who you're asking. And so I think when a person assesses themselves, they need to really go deep and figure out what parts aren't satisfying and why what things uh can be worked on and developed, right? Because to say that the goal is a more satisfying life means that uh it's not, it's perhaps not as satisfying as it could be, and so why is that and why? Why do I feel that way? So I think getting the answer to those questions can kind of help formulate what that first step will be towards that goal, whatever that goal is, and I think another um aspect of taking that first step is talk to others, um whatever, whatever goal that I have in mind that could give me the quote unquote, more satisfying life, do I know someone who has reached that goal, and if I do know someone, um how can I reach out to them and find out what it is they did to achieve it. And if I don't know someone, how can I get in touch with someone who has uh that may mean I need to network, that, may mean I need to get a life coach or a therapist. Um I feel like people help us get closer to our goals and our relationships with people help to connect us even if for instance that individual isn't able to help, they know another individual who is. So I think it's all about connection, I think it's about, you know, communicating what the goal is and what the needs are. And and again, asking why um also, another part of that first step is trying to figure out if the satisfying life I want to work towards, if it's actually already here, like where do my expectations lie? Am I are my expectations extremely high? Am I always chasing the next thing is what I want already here and I just don't see it because I'm not in gratitude? Those I think are things to consider because the more satisfying life that I quote unquote want may actually already be here, I may be living it. I just can't see it because perhaps I'm uh blind to it or you know, um take it for granted.

Um, I, I think that a lot of people in life, I think they've done surveys on this is that people are very unhappy because of finances. Um, and their, you know, their goals that they wanted and you know, they're being held back because of finances, you know, and I think that if the school system really took everyone and taught them ever since elementary school, you know, good money habits about real estate stock market, um, all of us as human beings would be better off financially right now, 1000, I believe that 1000% we would all be better off. But for some reason, um, you know, only certain people like the rich, the wealthy, certain race classes get to have the most knowledge about things. Um, and the rest of us have to go toil through life, you know, most of our lives and, and, and learn about that when we're into adulthood, when we have response possibilities now. So if you have a crappy job, you know, you gotta hold on to that crappy job while you try to, you know, get things, you know better for yourself as opposed to when you're younger when you don't have to have a job and you're mostly, you know, living with your parents and your parents are working and you, you have all the time in the world to dream and to develop your talents and um, you know, and then, you know, if you were able to start, you know doing healthy things, then that'd be that would be fast fantastic. But that's not always the case. So for me having a more financial satisfying life um is first getting out of debt and I've taken on more jobs uh to increase my income and um to start savings. Uh and for the first time, believe me and my and my uh was early forties, maybe maybe mid thirties I started at 41 K. Plan started retirement, which you know, you should have started that years, you should, you know, look back now and I'm Like, Wow, I should have been started in my 20's, you know, and you would have a small fortune right now, you know, and now the economy is bad the world, you know, different things in the world is bad. You know, we had a pandemic that we've never had, you know, to this extent before. So future looks kind of grim and sad and scary. Um but you have to still go move forward with with the knowledge now. Um and that's what I'm doing and one of the things is getting rid of debt which which helps out in in general everywhere because you know, you don't want to go into your later life with debt. You know, you may have medical expenses, you get older things happen, medical things happen you know, and uh you might have other expenses, maybe you want to buy a car or home or travel or help out with the grandkids or you know, and when you can't do it, you can't do, which, which makes you feel bad as you get older. You want to be able to help out the younger generation and be a stronghold for them, you know. So, um, so I have dreams of, of entrepreneurship and things that I want to do, but they cost money. I want to be independent and what I don't like to work hourly for my pay, uh, because I don't feel as a woman and as a woman of color that I get to pay, you know, I'm getting my equal pay as others. So, um, my happiness is, is being able to um, be able to provide for myself in all areas of my life and, and one of them is finances so I can get my, I can pay myself a good salary better than anyone else. Um, and have my salary my, you know, salary be able to uh afford me a better life and to fund my dreams and, and, and, and and allow me to help others. Um, so the first step towards that is getting rid of debt and um, and making smart money moves, which is exactly what I'm doing now.

Right. For instance, the other day, I mean like not the other day, like a few months ago, some, some work coworkers, some coworkers of mine wanted to go out to see a horse race and they invited me. So I, I obliged and I went and it was, I had a great time. I would have never gone to see a horse race in my life unless somebody invited me, I didn't even know really they existed, but being social and hanging out with people allowed me to figure that out. So hanging out and being more social with people would allow me to live a more satisfying life because then hopefully I can find a wife or I could find a significant other and that would also lead into a more satisfying life. So being more social would be like a snowballing effect into giving me more satisfaction in life and having a more fulfilling life.",103.29,300,174.266627940749,"2023-01-03T23:29:14.804Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-e32582b8-a39a-48c0-ba82-a18ece1a5c10/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5f5e22abacd23c0862700be4&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63b4b4ea58282dc2825cc6e1","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",15,"No"

Um Get a good job, get a job that I like um Like my last job was a good job, but I despised it. There's a lot of things like I wasn't passionate about the job that could have been one of the reasons that it affected me so bad. I also got the um interview the day my best friend passed away, so maybe that was like a trauma response, it sounds stupid, but I think that honestly might be one of the big reasons. Um But yeah my first step would be to get a good job because I have I have everything um I have a good boyfriend, I have a good family um But I need to get a job that doesn't um deteriorate my soul basically, I don't know if that makes sense but like my mental health and stuff are super important and I have to listen to those things and I I need to find something that I'm passionate in and that pays well. It's hard to find things that pay well these days. Like another thing like it's motivating to hear like my generation finding houses and stuff these days from my generation that everything is so freaking expensive.

And people there the first time I went in there, I was super nervous and ashamed, you know and people there were just extremely amazing and the most helpful people you can never talk to and uh it's really nice people but I don't know, it just has to be really satisfying to do that.

One of those jobs, I can find a Decent job that's just 9-5 that I like a little bit uh I'd really like to volunteer um my serve you know, food to the homeless or whatever. I'd really like to make um restaurant where food is actually cheap, you know, we're homeless people could come in there and get a bowl for free. Like you see on facebook, you know, come out of the dumpster coming here and give a slice of pizza. I think that would satisfy me very greatly to be able to help people in the capacity that I want to because it's like you can want to help people in life, but you gotta go, you know, we curate our shift first so that really sucks and I'd like to help people more.
