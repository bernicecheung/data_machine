And very few people actually get the things that they want. Um So first step towards that goal is to just re evaluate the things that you think you might want in life um and sort of like prioritize them until like you know is this a need right? Or is this is this something that's absolutely necessary? Like um for example eating food is obviously a need that is absolutely necessary, but like I don't know like say having a having a girlfriend or something or having a wife, well that's it's nice to have um it's not absolutely necessary for survival. Um So to like put your entire ego on whether or not you know you're gonna have a girlfriend or something. Um There's a very put you put put you in a very bad place if you can't fulfill that goal.

Once I do not have to worry about keeping the lights on whether once I do not have to worry about getting food for myself and my loved ones, then I can spend a little bit less time on that and focus more on other things that matter.

We fall into a bad habit of eating unhealthy and it takes a toll down, down, down the line. So it would always, to me personally, it would start off with being healthy and having a healthy life. Um I would also actually probably change that instead of eating will be stop smoking cigarettes. That would be my first step towards the goal for satisfying life, because cigarettes is very unhealthy and you can't be or you can't have a satisfying life if you're unhealthy and you don't feel good um cigarettes is a really bad habit and it can cause things like cancer um in your lungs or your heart and throat and it's not good.

First off, I would love to get a nice remote job or work from home job as I would rather stay in my apartment slash house or whatever all day personally, I think I would like remote work. I'd rather not have to go out of my apartment and interact with people often. So having a nice remote job, that is something I would want to do or at least pay very well is definitely a part and having a more satisfying life. The second thing I wish I could do would be moved to a different city. I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and it's okay, but I would rather live in a big city like Chicago or something like that. Obviously moving to a bigger city like that would require me to make more money, but overall I think I would rather be in a big city and have more things to do. I consider moving to phoenix Arizona or possibly some city in California, I'm not quite sure, but the point, the main thing is part of having more satisfying life for me would be moving to a bigger city where there are more things to do and also I would love to be able to afford my own property. Somebody like I mentioned before, it just doesn't matter what it is a house, a condominium or something though, I'm kind of leaning towards the condominium that way. I don't have to take care of as many things outside the property. That's what the first step towards these goals are. So for now I'm just focusing on paying off my debts.

I, when I was younger I got pulled out of school and missed a year and then my credits for some reason couldn't transfer.

But the main thing would be to graduate and then save up so that I can move, I plan my friend and I plan on moving to Iowa together because I mean no one's future is in Iowa but it's pretty cheap living. So it's good for now and I plan to share an apartment with him and a mutual friend.

Um But yeah, sometimes I just give a little experience hungry in general um but where I'm at, there's not really one concrete step you can take towards that, so I'm just I've been trying to refine my work to um find a better balance of, you know, find things that really work for me long term and that things will burn me out in the long run um And you know, ways I can, you know, leverage these things to actually bring in more money. Um I think I have a pretty good plan to do that um So far the last few months I've made some changes that have been working well so far, so um I guess the first step is to just be patient as annoying is sometimes that seems because, you know, the projects I'm working on it take a while to finish and all of that and things take well to build up, um takes a while to build up recent savings.

And so at the end of it we kind of took away like these are these are the things that satisfy you what you know what are you going to do? What are the goals um towards that.

Like for a very long time I dream was going into political political theory, not politics. I dread politics, but political theory theory is something I find very fascinating. In the first year of undergrad, I took this class about power and justice and I learned about certain dynamics of power. Like Michel Foucault's idea of Chopticon and I was just very driven by this philosophical niche that I was like, hey, I could read about this forever. I have really bad attention disorders and this was the one thing I just kept reading about. Like it's something I remember until now it's the one class. Remember anything from undergrad beyond even the classes that relate to my work now, I barely remember anything blows. But I remember reading Michelle from coast Works, I'm just becoming fascinated with them and I knew it was like, I want to study this field, but unfortunately I, I went to a stem field and while I'm possibly doing better in terms of like finances than I would, if I had went to political theory right? I don't, it just feels like everything I work for isn't something I want. So I guess in order for me to make my life more satisfying, it would have to be a pursuit of hedonism because I like, I want to, on one hand, it's like, yeah, maybe being altruistic and helping other people would bring bring me satisfaction, right? But the core of it, it's because I'm satisfied by these things and not satisfaction equates to happiness. Which is kind of a pursuit of hedonism. But generally yeah, like dedicate my life to like like the study of political theory. I want to go for a masters and PhD and that I would want to I have my attainable dream cars so I could, you know, go fast and here be loud. I want to have a cat in my little little apartment and I wanna spend my spare time volunteering. And that is what I would think is satisfying.

I just got a degree in computer information systems, and the job that I'm currently working doesn't really aligned with that. So being able to work in a position that more closely lines with my degree and interests and feels impactful is something that's very important to me and would lend to my sense of self as well as having higher pay would ease some of that financial burden that I currently have from the state of the world in general and also student loans and being underemployed for a couple of years. Despite working full time in college, I actually had an interview today and I'm expecting an offer letter by the end of the year, so I would qualify that as thief first step towards a goal of a more satisfying life because it's kind of going to be the jumping off point for my career, which will hopefully help me establish myself as an industry professional, get to a place where it can be successful and have more time and freedom to do things that I love.",107.69,276,153.77472374408,"2022-12-22T07:28:01.558Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-d285a79c-b930-41ec-99de-28d39b468a06/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5bc640334b3be500012d36aa&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a4025a4c4b8dc54c183bc5","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",28,"Yes"

Unfortunately humans have kind of put themselves into that that that bundle that hard, you know, you gotta have money to do this and that, I think money is so on human, you know, I mean for millions and millions of years of evolution, we were hunters and gatherers. You know, money wasn't even an issue. Money wasn't even an issue until, you know, rich people started making wars about it. That's the, you know, that's basically what it all boils down to is, you know, so I think money is, you know, they always say the money is the root of all evil, it kind of really is, you know, if you look at civilizations before that, yeah, we had civilizations, you know, competing against each other just for hunting and farming area. Um you know, early cultivation, uh you know, that established the very first societies, you know, sometimes they would go at war with each other just for resources, but I think the most satisfying, you know, way of living life is just to not have, you know, any of those any any worries about, you know, where we're getting food from and we're at a place right now where we're technical logically advanced enough that we could easily, you know, gear ourselves to a way of living where, you know, money isn't an issue. And that's what I'm trying to build. I'm trying to build a way of a more satisfying life or money. I create passive income, you know, money that just turns itself and set up some businesses and everything just kinda runs itself, so I never really have to pay attention to it, but it's enough money to um to live off of and pay the bills and the very few bills that I have. And uh and I think that's the best way of having a satisfying life, is not having any worries. No, no worries.

Um having an autoimmune condition. Um it's vital to keep the stress under control and then working a job that is probably 90% stress because all I do most days is put out fires, meet with the customers, meet with the internal teams, make sure that we're on track or if we're not on track that we're getting things on track or we're addressing the problems, all of that is high stress. And so because the things that I choose to do are so high stress, I need to make sure that the things um that I don't choose to do on my own, that is not my decision to make, um are as Easy to manage as possible. And unfortunately when I was about 12 years old, my extended family decided, Okay, she's gonna be the matriarch of our family, so we're gonna get her ready and I take pride in that position. I like being the matriarch at 48. Um, but it comes with a lot of unnecessary stress because sometimes my family just kind of wants my attention. They just want to talk about stuff and I have to tell them, uh, you do realize that what you're talking about, it's kind of stressful to me. For example, in my hometown, they've been experiencing some crime and so like my cousins and my sister and they all called me up and they're just like, oh, so and so and so got shot. Oh, this person got killed. Oh, we had this robbery, and I'm just going, no, no, no, no, no, let's not, let's not talk about that stuff right now. Uh, it's just conversation to them. But for me, it's not happy thoughts to think that my hometown, that I used to feel comfortable walking all over by myself being everywhere, because everybody knew everybody is now kind of turning into, um, a place where you have to consciously be aware of where you are and what you're doing and who's around you because crime is going up. So I think that I have to manage my stress better because the less time that I, I feel stressed then, the less time I'll be sick from the stress, which will give me more time and more energy to focus on the things that are important for me to achieve, such as my future goals. So first step is I need to manage the stress from external people and forces better so that I can have all of my energy to put forth onto my own personal goals.",163.87,457,167.327759809605,"2022-12-22T19:25:20.821Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-3fc6a90a-c97f-4703-a274-61af690acb1a/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=5e63912d08c2ef10e6a85688&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a4a70a6f3b56d1f3db763f","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",29,"Yes"

Like you see these Youtubers, these Youtubers make a lot of money and they only do Youtube and once you get youtube, you can, you know, do other things. You can do brand deals. You can put the money towards something else, like a, like a house, you know, rent the hat out, rent that house, rent that house out and create income, you know, um, the first step that I would take towards that goal, which I kind of already have, I have a Youtube channel but I only posted one. Only posted one video and then I stopped, but I would like to have a relationship channel because I feel like people love that stuff and that'll be really fun to document my life with my lover, you know, and yeah, I just noticed that I tend to watch a lot of videos like that on Youtube a couple couple channels and just deserving relationship and you know, learning from them. And um, ah, I guess since I want to make a couple channel, my first step towards that goal would be making the channel, which I already have done and then I guess putting myself out there to find A boyfriend I haven't dated in three years and um I think that I'm ready to start dating again. So yeah, I think of my life more satisfying because I would have a group of supporters and I really find it beautiful to like just capture moments in your life that will never happen again and post it. Um and to share it with people and let people, you know, be with the way they view it in blah blah and yeah, those will be there forever for people to view. Even if you're not with that person anymore, you still can view it and anyone can do it and you post on Youtube and it's just really cool. Did I answer the question I did reset it If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal? So my first step towards that goal would be I guess it could be creating the, will be creating no, the first step towards that goal is finding a partner, a nice high value partner and then, you know, starting to take videos on my iphone, doesn't have to be a fancy camera, you just take it on your phone and then upload it, take it from there, you know, and with that comes, you know, other stuff, you know, brand deals and um another source of income and all that stuff.

I've always wanted to live on a farm again, for, as I mentioned, my family emigrated from the soviet Union to the farm in pennsylvania with no running water, electricity and the life on the farm. And you know when you own your own mountain, which is what we had, we literally on the mountain, um, it's just, you know, there's nothing to compare it to that kind of life. It's beautiful to be able to wake up in the morning, pick fresh blueberries, apples, pears, make pancakes from scratch, literally picking wheat yourself all of this and just going into deep into the forest, finding new rivers and lakes and streams and creeks that, that you own. It's really cool. And so I guess the first step towards that would be, you know, maybe getting a part time job and doing that while I'm in school before I do only have a short period of time in school and I think even with this goal in mind that accomplishing that would be beneficial to get to this place to get on that farm.",110.83,286,154.831724262384,"2022-12-24T08:25:46.997Z","https://www.cameratag.com/assets/v-1b9eda85-c300-4ecd-bfc3-a81de1649885/mp3.mp3","https://lotic.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9NwfGbrxyxUZOku?PROLIFIC_PID=633fce40238b274171326345&STUDY_ID=639e73b38884ae6555e593ca&SESSION_ID=63a6b0f72bf0decfd0567534","a-b14b7c20-5f43-013b-1cdd-02c7c2460d41",FALSE,FALSE,"Goals","Goals","If your goal was a more satisfying life, what would be your first step towards that goal?","Lets talk about wellbeing","prompt_01",32,"Yes"

Um one where I could be paid more maybe. Um As of right now I am a Shiflett at um a little food place on the campus that I I I attend the campus I live on at and as a shift lead I don't feel like my pay really represents the responsibilities I have. So I would probably look for a job that would pay me the right amount for the responsibility for the responsibilities I partake in. I'm in charge of or a job that would involve last responsibilities because even now I received a small raise and I'm still being paid well below what a shift should be being paid and the responsibilities are just countless. So if I wanted a more satisfying life I would search for a job with either less responsibilities or better paper responsibilities. I would also probably exercise more. Um Although I'm pretty satisfied not exercising so I'm not sure if I would do that. But I think honestly finding a new job would help me gaining more satisfying life completely. I really do think it would do that. But I might have to, I might have to go for a job that pays less with better hours as eventually moving through the ranks would allow me to To receive the right pay. For example, I have a friend who works at Starbucks on campus as a ship lead and she makes $14 an hour which still isn't great but it is much better And they start at 11, I get paid 12 as a shift lead at the place I work that is also on campus. And if I started at Starbucks brand new I would probably start at 11. But I might be able to negotiate to 12 if I told them I was a shift lead somewhere else. But I don't really have any barista experience. I don't know if I could do that kind of just thinking a lot.

I think a lot of people can be any weight they want to be and, and that's good for them and healthy for them.

Um Because honestly that's the key to a more satisfying life um is to not you can it's not that it's bad to want for more and pursue more, but to find satisfaction in what you do have or recognize um the silver linings or the or the positive points or you know, just find things to be grateful for in your current life are really the key to feeling more satisfied. Um So I mean I guess that kind of that kind of takes the takes the cake is my answer. I was gonna say the other thing I was hovering between would be for me to have a more satisfying life would be to break my food addiction. Um I think I could probably get a lot done if I could get a handle on that because again, like I even said in one of my previous answers, I will purposefully eat, I will just emotionally eat knowing that I will feel like shit just so that I can purposefully disarm myself from having the motivation to do anything that will disturb my current status quo. Food is is a toxin for me and that's not all food. Obviously healthy food is not a toxin for me, but I I weaponize it, I wield it like a weapon towards myself and um I have to find satisfaction in things other than food. I mean I guess that really kind of ties back into the gratefulness, finding finding things in my life to be grateful for and feeling like that's enough being able to stand on the strength of that. That's not to say that I don't because if if I did in my mental state would be in tatters compared to where I'm at now. But sincerely, food is way too much of a centerpiece in my life. Everything revolves around. If I think about food, I think about what I'm gonna eat next, what I'm going to eat. Um it's just a literal obsession. It's an addiction I think, and I need to get a better hold on that and anyone who's addicted to anything can greatly improve their life by kicking their addiction.

Who gives you bonuses and incentives to increase your resources and you take these resources and you save them for later. The first step goal is increasing your resources.

The sooner you're out of debt the less uh you owe others of your resources, allowing an increase of your resources to be more percentage of your own.

It's just like a terrible thing that just praise on low attention span and like low motivation. That's what I cut out immediately. Um That's the first, I mean, that's the first thing I would do. It would just be honest on instagram, but I need, and I've always told you to, and Tiktok, I want to solve those. But on installing instagram, like I needed to communicate. That's the thing I need to message and view other people's lives post on myself, you know what I'm saying? Um, but I guess it would be probably to develop the habit to delete it and then develop the habit of just go on instagram once a day, maybe twice a day, just on my laptop because I'm not gonna watch like instagram reels on my laptop. Um, just going at once a day to communicate and then just just laid off my phone, that will be the first step because once it's away, it's like, what else is there to do with my phone? I'm not even opening up for anything at that point because I deleted everything else. Um, and now it's satisfy me more. I guess I would still have to fill my time with doing other meaningful things that would make me have a more satisfying life. But that would be easily the easiest and first step I would take.
